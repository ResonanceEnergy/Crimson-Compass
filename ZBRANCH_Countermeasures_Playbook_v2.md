# ZBRANCH Countermeasures Playbook (v2)

Unified naming: **COUNTERMEASURE** everywhere.
- Personal-layer countermeasures use tag: `layer:personal`.

Core loop integration:
Lead → Countermeasure Encounter → Snap (Heat/Time/Integrity/Flags) → Hypothesis → Disproof (exactly ONE) → Commitment.

Design guarantees:
- Non-lethal, abstract effects only (exposure/time/misdirection/attribution).
- 3–5 choices per scene.
- Each choice has 1 Primary effect and may seed 1 Shadow effect.
