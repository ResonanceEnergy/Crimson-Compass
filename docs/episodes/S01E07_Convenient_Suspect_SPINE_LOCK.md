**Dialogue:**

**Helix:** "Alright team, evidence bags out and remember: this is a frame job, not a whodunit. ZTech, no reprogramming the security cameras. Optimus, try not to confuse the evidence scanner with a barcode reader."

**Optimus:** "Deception patterns detected. Probability of false flag operation: 89.2%. This misdirection... it's too perfect. Someone's been very methodical."

**ZTech:** "Their security is laughable! Check this pattern detector I built - it also brews coffee and predicts when it'll rain! Maximum absurdity, maximum function!"

**Gasket:** (sudden holographic appearance, urgent) "Not methodical. Dangerous. The compass sees the patterns... deception ghosts in the evidence."

**Player Choice Options:**

1. **X (Helix):** "Coordinate forensic team for proper evidence collection."
   - **Consequence:** Systematic collection reveals evidence staging timeline and fabrication methods.
   - **Dialogue:** Helix: "Good instincts. Evidence tells stories. And right now, someone's story is full of holes."

2. **Y (Optimus):** "Analyze the deception patterns statistically."
   - **Consequence:** Statistical analysis reveals the frame-up's mathematical improbability and premeditation.
   - **Dialogue:** Optimus: "The deception patterns... they're not random. Probability of natural occurrence: 0.03%."

3. **Z (ZTech):** "Deploy evidence analysis drones. Tech to the rescue!"
   - **Consequence:** Drones scan the scene but also accidentally trigger a security lockdown.
   - **Dialogue:** ZTech: "My drones work perfectly! Except for the one that started analyzing air quality. But hey, we got the patterns!"

4. **G (Gasket):** "Trust the compass - the deception anomalies show the real frame."
   - **Consequence:** Compass reveals the decoy suspect is being manipulated by a larger conspiracy.
   - **Dialogue:** Gasket: (haunted voice) "The convenient suspect... it's not convenient. The compass remembers these deception scars."

**Dialogue:**

**Decoy Suspect:** (terrified, confused) "I didn't do anything! The evidence... it was planted! I swear I was set up!"

**Helix:** "Oh sweetie, 'set up' with perfectly staged evidence? That's like saying a frame job is just bad luck. Now, about those deception patterns..."

**Optimus:** "Pattern analysis shows premeditated staging. Probability of coordinated operation: 95.6%. Most... calculated."

**ZTech:** "Their staging is child's play! I could expose it with this camera! It also takes selfies and predicts the weather!"

**Gasket:** (appearing urgently, fragmented) "The patterns... they're not just evidence. Someone's testing deception limits. The compass sees the frame."

**Decoy Suspect:** (breaking down) "The patterns... they were everywhere! I didn't create them! Someone else did!"

**Helix:** "And that's exactly what we're going to find out. Now, about those staging contacts..."

## Scene 3: Resolution (1 minute)

**Background:** Security operations center with exposed frame evidence, pattern displays, and team debrief setup.

**Narrative:** The sabotage is prevented and the decoy arrested, but the compass reveals disturbing deception patterns.

**Case Closure (95%):** Sabotage prevented, decoy arrested, immediate false flag operation dismantled.

**Shadow Unease (5%):** Exit plan staged before the crime appears in multiple cases. The compass detects premeditated deception patterns suggesting a coordinated false flag network.

**Team Debrief:**

**Helix:** "Well handled, Player. Though I could do without the holographic warnings from our phantom friend."

**Optimus:** "Disturbing deception patterns. The premeditated staging suggests sophisticated manipulation. Most... troubling."

**ZTech:** "My pattern detector worked perfectly! Except for the coffee brewing. And the weather predictions. But the frame? Exposed!"

**Gasket:** (fading, haunted) "The patterns... they're just the beginning. The deception breaches... they go deeper than you know."

**Epilogue Hook:** The exit plans trace back to pre-staged scenarios that were prepared months in advance. The pattern suggests someone is building a comprehensive false flag operation network.
