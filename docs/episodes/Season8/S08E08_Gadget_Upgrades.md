# S08E08: Gadget Upgrades

## Episode Overview
**SPINE LOCK Compliance:** This episode fully implements SPINE LOCK design standards with standardized character ensemble (Player as Compass Master, Optimus as Bumbling Boomer Executive, Helix as Big Sister Administrative Glue, ZTech as Nerd Soldier Tech Genius, Gasket as Broken Prodigy), Crimson Compass quantum navigation mechanics (pirate-tech aesthetic with evolving AI), dual narrative system (95% closure/5% unease), and Futurama Detective Noir + Uncharted Action-Adventure visual fusion.

**Case:** The team undertakes comprehensive gadget upgrades to counter the evolving shadow threats, learning that technology must adapt as quickly as the enemies it combats.

**Tokens:** Upgrade tokens enhance capabilities but reveal that technological advancement creates new vulnerabilities.

**Theme:** Technology is a double-edged sword - upgrades provide power but also create dependencies and new weaknesses for enemies to exploit.

**Duration:** 5-minute micro-episode with integrated compass mini-puzzles and treasure hunting elements.
