## Character Ensemble (Futurama Uncharted Vibes)

### The Closer (Player) - "Gasket's Replacement"
Navigating the sterile environment while trying to keep the Crimson Compass from setting off contamination alarms. The device seems unusually sensitive to the facility's quantum containment fields.

### Optimus (Agent Y) - "The Bumbling Boomer Executive"
Completely out of his element in the high-tech clean room, constantly worried about contaminating the environment. Keeps trying to use outdated industrial protocols from the 21st century.

### Helix (Agent X) - "Big Sister Administrative Glue"
Excels at coordinating with facility staff and navigating bureaucratic protocols. Her administrative skills cut through red tape while maintaining professional relationships.

### ZTech (Agent Z) - "Nerd Soldier Tech Genius"
In his element with the high-tech equipment, but his gadgets keep causing contamination scares. Creates a "clean room survival kit" that includes a laser pointer coffee maker and anti-static socks.

### Gasket (Agent G) - "Broken Prodigy"
Absent this episode, but his influence lingers - the compass occasionally displays his old case notes about similar industrial espionage incidents.

### NPCs
- **Facility Manager:** Mid-50s, defensive, lab coat, takes contamination protocols way too seriously
- **Insider (Culprit):** Mid-30s, nervous, maintenance uniform, sweating under the clean suit
- **Quality Control Tech:** Early 40s, detail-oriented, glasses, obsessed with particle counts
- **Security Guard:** Late 30s, by-the-book, uniform, treats everyone like they're radioactive

## Scene 1: Facility Inspection

**Background:** Sterile clean room with air filtration systems, conveyor belts, inspection stations. Workers in protective gear, monitoring screens. The air shimmers with containment fields that make the Crimson Compass hum with interference.

**Narrative:** You've infiltrated the clean room facility where micro-components are manufactured. Suspicious waste containers are being moved out more frequently. The compass detects quantum signature anomalies in the air filtration system.

**Compass Mini-Puzzle:** Contamination Scan
- **Objective:** Use compass to detect hidden component transport
- **Mechanics:** Scan air particles for quantum signatures, identify contamination vectors
- **Solution:** Waste containers show elevated quantum readings from prototype components
- **Reward:** Early detection of smuggling method

**Puzzle:** Waste Volume Analysis
- **Objective:** Compare waste manifests with production records
- **Mechanics:** Graph analysis, anomaly detection
- **Solution:** Waste volume exceeds production by 23%
- **Clue:** Hidden compartments in waste containers

**Dialogue:**

**Facility Manager:** (adjusting his clean suit nervously) "This is a secure facility! You can't just walk in here without clearance. Do you know how many air changes per hour we maintain? 47! That's more than a hospital!"

**Helix:** "We have clearance, sir. And we're more concerned about what's leaving than entering. Now, about these waste manifests... they seem a tad... inflated."

**ZTech:** "Whoa, check these air filters! They're calibrated for something extra heavy. Like, carrying-micro-components heavy! Oh, and this contamination detector I built? It also brews coffee and tells jokes. Maximum absurdity!"

**Optimus:** "Particle analysis shows contamination levels 23% above baseline. In my day, we called that 'suspicious.' Today they probably have an app for it."

**Player Choice Options:**

1. **X (Helix):** "Request facility tour and staff interviews. Build trust first."
   - **Consequence:** Staff cooperation reveals nervous behavior from maintenance crew.
   - **Dialogue:** Helix: "People talk when you listen. And right now, someone's sweating more than they should in this clean room."

2. **Y (Optimus):** "Run full contamination analysis. Data never lies."
   - **Consequence:** Scientific analysis confirms component smuggling but triggers facility lockdown.
   - **Dialogue:** Optimus: "The numbers don't lie. Unlike some facility managers with their 'perfect' contamination records."

3. **Z (ZTech):** "Deploy contamination detector drone swarm. Tech to the rescue!"
   - **Consequence:** Drones find hidden compartments but also cause a minor containment breach.
   - **Dialogue:** ZTech: "My drones work perfectly! Except for the one that started reciting Shakespeare. But hey, we got the evidence!"

4. **G (Compass):** "Trust the compass readings - something's off with that filtration system."
   - **Consequence:** Compass leads to discovering the quantum signature masking technique.
   - **Dialogue:** Gasket: (through compass) "Old trick... hide the valuable in the worthless. But quantum signatures... they always leave echoes."

## Scene 2: Insider Confrontation

**Background:** Maintenance corridor behind clean room, exposed pipes, storage lockers. Dim lighting, industrial sounds. The compass shows contamination vectors leaking from hidden compartments.

**Narrative:** You confront the insider in the waste processing area. They claim the extra waste is due to production errors, but the compass reveals quantum signatures that tell a different story.

**Puzzle:** Component Matching
- **Objective:** Match recovered components to production schematics
- **Mechanics:** Drag-and-drop identification, serial number verification
- **Solution:** Components are from restricted prototype line
- **Clue:** Unique engraving marks

**Environmental Interaction:** Waste Processing
- **Choice:** Careful inspection vs. direct accusation
- **Consequence:** Careful approach finds quantum signature evidence; direct accusation causes evidence destruction attempt

**Dialogue:**

**Insider:** (wiping sweat from brow, voice cracking) "It's just scrap! Quality control rejects happen all the time. You can't prove anything!"

**Helix:** "Oh sweetie, please. I've seen more convincing liars at a corporate sensitivity training seminar. Those 'rejects' have quantum signatures that match the prototype line. And that sweat? Not from the clean room environment."

**Optimus:** "Your access logs show 47 after-hours entries. Probability of legitimate maintenance: 3.2%. The contamination patterns suggest deliberate transport, not accidental rejects."

**ZTech:** "These components? They're from the restricted prototype batch! I can tell by the engraving. Oh, and check this particle analyzer - it also predicts stock market trends and suggests lunch options!"

**Quality Tech:** (adjusting glasses, shocked) "Those components shouldn't be in waste. They're from the new prototype batch. Someone deliberately routed them here!"

**Insider:** (panicking) "It wasn't my idea! They said it was just 'recycling'! The money was too good!"

**Facility Manager:** (defensive) "This is outrageous! My facility has the best contamination protocols in the industry!"

**Helix:** "Best protocols, maybe. Best security? That's debatable. Now, about those quantum signatures..."

## Puzzles & Mechanics

### Air Filtration Anomaly
- **Type:** Environmental Analysis
- **Description:** Detect unusual particle concentrations
- **Solution:** Filters masking component transport
- **Reward:** Hidden compartment location

### Waste Stream Tracking
- **Type:** Flow Diagram
- **Description:** Trace waste from production to disposal
- **Choices:** Physical inspection, digital tracking, witness interviews
- **Consequences:** Different evidence discovery paths

## Episode Resolution

**Case Closure (95%):** Insider exposed, espionage pipeline halted, micro-components secured. The facility implements new quantum monitoring protocols.

**Shadow Unease (5%):** Components were auto-routed to a "custody destination nobody requested" - a secure facility that doesn't exist in any database. The compass readings suggest deliberate quantum manipulation.

**Team Debrief:**

**Helix:** "Well handled, Closer. Nothing like a good old-fashioned insider threat to keep things interesting. Though I could do without the clean suits."

**Optimus:** "Fascinating contamination patterns. Almost as complex as the corporate excuses we just heard."

**ZTech:** "My contamination detector worked perfectly! Except for the Shakespeare drone. And the stock tips. But the evidence? Spot on!"

**Gasket:** (compass echo) "Quantum signatures... they linger. Like ghosts in the machine. Some destinations... they call to you."

**Epilogue Hook:** The "custody destination" appears in old facility blueprints from 50 years ago, but was digitally erased. The pattern suggests a long-term industrial espionage network.
