# S01E03: Clean Room

## Episode Overview
**Title:** Clean Room  
**Case:** Insider moves micro-components out via "approved waste"  
**Case Token:** Insider exposed; pipeline halted  
**Shadow Token:** Components auto-routed to custody destination nobody requested  
**Theme:** Industrial espionage, insider threats  

## Character Descriptions

### Player (The Closer)
- **Appearance:** Protective gear over business attire, analytical focus
- **Background:** Learning to navigate corporate-industrial environments
- **Personality:** Methodical investigation of physical evidence

### Advisors
- **Helix:** Coordinating with facility staff
- **Optimus:** Analyzing production anomalies
- **ZTech:** Technical inspection of equipment
- **Gasket:** Not present this episode

### NPCs
- **Facility Manager:** Mid-50s, defensive, lab coat
- **Insider (Culprit):** Mid-30s, nervous, maintenance uniform
- **Quality Control Tech:** Early 40s, detail-oriented, glasses
- **Security Guard:** Late 30s, by-the-book, uniform

## Scene 1: Facility Inspection

**Background:** Sterile clean room with air filtration systems, conveyor belts, inspection stations. Workers in protective gear, monitoring screens.

**Narrative:** You've infiltrated the clean room facility where micro-components are manufactured. Suspicious waste containers are being moved out more frequently.

**Puzzle:** Waste Volume Analysis  
- **Objective:** Compare waste manifests with production records  
- **Mechanics:** Graph analysis, anomaly detection  
- **Solution:** Waste volume exceeds production by 23%  
- **Clue:** Hidden compartments in waste containers

**Dialogue:**

**Facility Manager:** "This is a secure facility. You can't just walk in here without clearance."

**Helix:** "We have clearance. And questions about your waste management."

**ZTech:** "Whoa, check these air filters! They're calibrated for something extra heavy."

## Scene 2: Insider Confrontation

**Background:** Maintenance corridor behind clean room, exposed pipes, storage lockers. Dim lighting, industrial sounds.

**Narrative:** You confront the insider in the waste processing area. They claim the extra waste is due to production errors.

**Puzzle:** Component Matching  
- **Objective:** Match recovered components to production schematics  
- **Mechanics:** Drag-and-drop identification, serial number verification  
- **Solution:** Components are from restricted prototype line  
- **Clue:** Unique engraving marks

**Dialogue:**

**Insider:** "It's just scrap! Quality control rejects happen all the time."

**Optimus:** "Your access logs show 47 after-hours entries. Coincidence?"

**Quality Tech:** "Those components shouldn't be in waste. They're from the new prototype batch."

## Puzzles & Mechanics

### Air Filtration Anomaly
- **Type:** Environmental Analysis
- **Description:** Detect unusual particle concentrations
- **Solution:** Filters masking component transport
- **Reward:** Hidden compartment location

### Waste Stream Tracking
- **Type:** Flow Diagram
- **Description:** Trace waste from production to disposal
- **Choices:** Physical inspection, digital tracking, witness interviews
- **Consequences:** Different evidence discovery paths
