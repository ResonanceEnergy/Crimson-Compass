## Scene 1: Shadow Investigation (2 minutes)

**Background:** Industrial facility with shadow detection systems, machinery arrays, and security monitoring. Shadow anomaly zones and hidden sabotage caches for investigative approaches.

**Narrative:** The team investigates industrial sabotage while learning shadow detection basics. The Crimson Compass detects shadow anomalies that reveal Gasket's past detection failures.

**Compass Mini-Puzzle:** Shadow Anomaly Detection - Detection Shadow Analysis
- **Objective:** Use compass to detect and analyze shadow anomalies during sabotage investigation
- **Mechanics:** Scan for shadow interference, identify detection pattern disruptions, stabilize compass readings
- **Solution:** Shadow anomalies reveal sabotage methods and Gasket's trauma connections
- **Reward:** Access to hidden sabotage evidence and shadow stabilization tools

**Treasure Hunting Element:** Facility Exploration - Shadow Relic Hunt
- **Choice:** Direct sabotage investigation vs. shadow anomaly exploration
- **Consequence:** Direct investigation yields sabotage data but risks shadow destabilization; anomaly exploration reveals detection evidence

**Dialogue:**

**Helix:** "Shadow detection training and sabotage investigation. Remember: shadows are like secrets, and we're the detectives. ZTech, no shadow experiments that create permanent darkness. Optimus, shadows aren't just statistical outliers."

**Optimus:** "Shadow anomalies detected. Probability of detection interference: 82.1%. These patterns... they match Gasket's old detection failures."

**ZTech:** "Their shadows are primitive! Check this detector I built - it also predicts eclipses and makes toast! Maximum absurdity, maximum function!"

**Gasket:** (sudden holographic appearance, urgent) "Shadows... they're not just darkness. Dangerous. The sabotage... it manipulates detection paths."

**Player Choice Options:**

1. **X (Helix):** "Coordinate shadow training protocols and sabotage investigation safety."
   - **Consequence:** Systematic approach reveals sabotage timeline and shadow requirements.
   - **Dialogue:** Helix: "Good coordination. Shadows and sabotage need careful handling. And right now, someone's detection is about to get very exposed."

2. **Y (Optimus):** "Analyze the shadow anomalies statistically."
   - **Consequence:** Statistical analysis reveals the detection pattern disruptions and sabotage methods.
   - **Dialogue:** Optimus: "The shadow patterns... they're not random. Probability of Gasket's past involvement: 75.6%."

3. **Z (ZTech):** "Deploy shadow detection drones. Tech to the rescue!"
   - **Consequence:** Drones stabilize shadows but also accidentally trigger security protocols.
   - **Dialogue:** ZTech: "My drones work perfectly! Except for the one that started analyzing employee shadow habits. But hey, we got the shadows!"

4. **G (Gasket):** "Trust the compass - the shadow anomalies show the real detection fractures."
   - **Consequence:** Compass reveals the sabotage is connected to Gasket's mysterious detection failures.
   - **Dialogue:** Gasket: (haunted voice) "The shadow first steps... they're not just training. The compass remembers the hidden paths."

## Scene 2: Sabotage Exposure & Shadow Confrontation (2 minutes)

**Background:** Detection control room with shadow displays, machinery terminals, and security systems. Shadow manipulation points and hidden sabotage caches for action sequences.

**Narrative:** The confrontation reveals the sabotage suspect's shadow manipulation techniques. The Crimson Compass detects shadow anomalies that expose detection fractures from Gasket's past.

**Puzzle:** Sabotage Containment & Shadow Analysis
- **Objective:** Contain sabotage while analyzing shadow manipulation patterns
- **Mechanics:** Secure compromised systems, decode shadow signatures, identify trauma connections
- **Solution:** Sabotage contained, shadow patterns reveal Gasket's past detection failures
- **Clue:** Shadow anomalies match patterns from Gasket's mysterious trauma

**Environmental Interaction:** Control Room Chase - Shadow Pursuit
- **Choice:** Pursue suspect directly vs. secure shadow data first
- **Consequence:** Direct pursuit captures suspect but allows data loss; securing data first reveals shadow evidence
- **Cinematic Element:** Dynamic pursuit through control room with climbing and environmental puzzles

**Dialogue:**

**Sabotage Suspect:** (defensive, backing against control panel) "I was just manipulating shadows! The detection issues... they're not my fault!"

**Helix:** "Oh sweetie, 'not my fault' shadow manipulations? That's like saying sabotage is just a prank. Now, about those detection fracture patterns..."

**Optimus:** "Shadow analysis shows detection interference. Probability of past trauma connection: 88.4%. Most... revealing."

**ZTech:** "Their sabotage is child's play! I could contain it with this interface! It also plays music and predicts the weather!"

**Gasket:** (appearing urgently, fragmented) "The shadows... they're not just darkness. Someone's manipulating detection paths. The compass sees the sabotage."

**Sabotage Suspect:** (breaking down) "The patterns... they were everywhere! I didn't create them! Someone else did!"

**Helix:** "And that's exactly what we're going to find out. Now, about those sabotage contacts..."

## Scene 3: Resolution (1 minute)

**Background:** Shadow control room with stabilized compass, sabotage evidence displays, and team debrief setup.

**Narrative:** The sabotage operation is exposed and shadow manipulation neutralized, but the compass reveals disturbing shadow anomalies.

**Case Closure (95%):** Sabotage operation exposed, shadow manipulation neutralized, immediate threat neutralized.

**Shadow Unease (5%):** Shadow anomalies reveal Gasket's detection trauma patterns suggesting deeper personal connections.

**Team Debrief:**

**Helix:** "Well handled, Player. Though I could do without the holographic warnings from our spectral companion."

**Optimus:** "Disturbing shadow patterns. The detection fractures suggest Gasket's past involvement. Most... concerning."

**ZTech:** "My stabilizer worked perfectly! Except for the coffee brewing. And the weather predictions. But the sabotage? Contained!"

**Gasket:** (fading, haunted) "The shadows... they're just the beginning. The fractures... they go deeper than you know."

**Epilogue Hook:** The shadow anomalies hint at Gasket's mysterious detection failures, suggesting the team's compass training will uncover more about their spectral companion's past.
