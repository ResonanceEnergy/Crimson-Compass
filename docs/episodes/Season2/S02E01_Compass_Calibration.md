**Case Token:** Spy network dismantled; stolen research recovered
**Shadow Token:** Compass readings show impossible "echo locations" (Gasket's past incident sites)
**Theme:** Learning basic compass mechanics and investigation fundamentals

## Character Ensemble (Season 2 Evolution)

### The Closer (Player) - "Compass Initiate"
One month into the job, you're still getting used to the Crimson Compass's quirks. The holographic displays now occasionally show you "tutorial flashbacks" - brief visions of Gasket using the same device in past cases. You're learning to trust its "truth vectors" while questioning whether the compass is teaching you... or testing you. The contrast between its ancient pirate-navigator aesthetic and quantum-tech capabilities creates constant humorous moments.

### Optimus (Agent Y) - "Technological Adaptation"
Optimus is struggling with the compass's advanced interface, often yelling at it like an old rotary phone. "Hello? Compass? Can you hear me?" He's discovered he has an uncanny natural talent for interpreting the device's probability matrices, even if he can't operate the touchscreens properly. His deadpan reactions to the compass's absurd features provide comic relief while his strategic mind helps navigate the truth vectors.

### Helix (Agent X) - "Compass Coordinator"
Helix has taken it upon herself to create a "compass usage manual" for the team, complete with coffee-order integration. She's fascinated by how the device seems to respond differently to each team member - calm and precise with you, erratic with Optimus, overenthusiastic with ZTech, and haunted with Gasket. Her administrative skills now include "compass calibration sessions" where she mediates between the device and its users.

### ZTech (Agent Z) - "Compass Enhancer"
ZTech has fallen in love with the compass, seeing it as the ultimate gadget. He's already built three "compass companion devices" - a belt buckle that auto-translates compass readings, glasses that overlay truth vectors on reality, and a pen that can "draw" compass paths in mid-air. His enthusiasm often leads to over-engineering, but his technical brilliance helps unlock the compass's more advanced features.

### Gasket (Agent G) - "Compass Ghost"
Gasket appears more frequently now, drawn by your use of "his" compass. He provides cryptic guidance about calibration techniques he developed, but his presence seems to make the compass more... aware. Sometimes it shows readings that correlate with locations from his "incident," hinting at connections you're not ready to understand yet.

## Scene 1: Calibration Briefing (2 minutes)

**Background:** Agency briefing room with holographic displays and ergonomic furniture that adjusts to user mood. The Crimson Compass sits on the central table, its brass casing gleaming under the lights.

**Narrative:** Optimus has called a mandatory "compass calibration session" after your first month of field work. The device has been showing inconsistent readings, and Helix has prepared a comprehensive training manual.

**Dialogue:**

**Optimus:** "Closer. The compass has been... temperamental. Showing readings that don't match our databases. Probability of user error: 67%. Or is it the device?"

**Helix:** "Now, now, Optimus. The compass just needs proper calibration. I've prepared a 47-page manual with coffee breaks scheduled. And Closer - how's it been treating you? Any more of those sea shanty interludes?"

**ZTech:** "Ooh, calibration! I built this calibrator drone - it sings show tunes while adjusting quantum matrices! Maximum absurdity, maximum precision!"

**Gasket:** (appearing in the doorway, voice distant) "Calibration... it's not just about the device. It's about the user. The compass chooses who it trusts."

**Player Compass Interaction:** The compass activates, showing a holographic tutorial of Gasket's hands performing calibration gestures from years ago.

## Scene 2: Field Calibration (2 minutes)

**Background:** Quantum research facility exterior - sleek, modern architecture with security drones patrolling. Rain-slicked surfaces reflect neon lights.

**Narrative:** A tip leads you to a research facility where industrial spies are attempting to steal quantum research. The compass readings are erratic, requiring on-site calibration.

**Puzzle:** Quantum Signature Matching
- **Objective:** Match energy signatures to identify the stolen prototype
- **Mechanics:** Use compass to scan 4 prototype locations, cross-reference with facility database
- **Solution:** One signature shows impossible "echo" - matching a location from Gasket's incident
- **Clue:** Compass overlay shows temporal distortions around the target

**Team Dynamics:**

**Helix:** "Okay team, let's calibrate and coordinate. Optimus - try not to yell at the compass this time. ZTech - no show tunes until we're inside."

**Optimus:** "These readings... they suggest temporal anomalies. Or perhaps I need new data glasses. Probability of equipment malfunction: 89%."

**ZTech:** "Temporal anomalies? That's my jam! I built a temporal flux detector last week. It also makes toast!"

**Gasket:** (whispering to you) "The echoes... they're not random. The compass is showing you my path. But why now?"

## Scene 3: Resolution (1 minute)

**Background:** Facility interior - sterile white corridors with quantum containment fields humming.

**Narrative:** The calibrated compass reveals the spy network's full extent, leading to a clean bust. But the final reading shows an impossible "echo location" that matches one of Gasket's incident sites.

**95% Closure:** Spies arrested, research recovered, case closed.

**5% Unease:** The compass shows a truth vector pointing to a location that "shouldn't exist" - hinting at Gasket's mysterious past.

**Cliffhanger Setup:** As you hand the compass back to Optimus, it briefly displays coordinates for next week's case... coordinates that match another of Gasket's incident sites.

## Puzzles & Mechanics

### Compass Calibration Sequence
- **Type:** Interactive Tutorial
- **Description:** Follow holographic Gasket's hands to perform calibration gestures
- **Solution:** Match gesture sequence perfectly (with humorous failure animations)
- **Reward:** Unlocks "Echo Detection" mode

### Signature Analysis
- **Type:** Pattern Matching with Compass Overlay
- **Description:** Scan multiple locations, identify anomalies
- **Choices:** Focus on energy readings, temporal distortions, or personnel patterns
- **Consequences:** Wrong focus increases heat, right focus reveals shadow token
