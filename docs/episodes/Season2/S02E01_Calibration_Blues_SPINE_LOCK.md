## Scene 1: Calibration Investigation (2 minutes)

**Background:** Corporate headquarters with calibration labs, data centers, and security checkpoints. Compass calibration interference creating reality fracture anomalies. Training facilities and server rooms for investigative approaches.

**Narrative:** The team investigates corporate espionage while calibrating the Crimson Compass, encountering anomalies that hint at Gasket's mysterious past. The compass reveals calibration issues tied to reality fractures.

**Compass Mini-Puzzle:** Calibration Anomaly Detection - Anomaly Detection
- **Objective:** Use compass to detect and resolve calibration anomalies during investigation
- **Mechanics:** Scan for calibration interference, identify reality fracture patterns, stabilize compass readings
- **Solution:** Calibration anomalies reveal espionage methods and Gasket's trauma connections
- **Reward:** Access to hidden data breach evidence and calibration stabilization tools

**Treasure Hunting Element:** Corporate Investigation - Relic Calibration
- **Choice:** Direct espionage confrontation vs. calibration anomaly investigation
- **Consequence:** Direct confrontation yields espionage relics but risks compass destabilization; calibration investigation reveals reality fracture evidence

**Dialogue:**

**Helix:** "Alright team, calibration day and remember: this is compass training, not a tech support call. ZTech, no experimenting with the calibration matrix. Optimus, try not to confuse the anomaly scanner with a thermometer."

**Optimus:** "Calibration anomalies detected. Probability of reality fracture interference: 73.9%. This compass... it's haunted by more than just Gasket."

**ZTech:** "Their calibration is laughable! Check this stabilizer I built - it also brews coffee and predicts when it'll rain! Maximum absurdity, maximum function!"

**Gasket:** (sudden holographic appearance, urgent) "Not just haunted. Dangerous. The calibration... it stirs old fractures."

**Player Choice Options:**

1. **X (Helix):** "Coordinate team calibration protocols and investigation safety."
   - **Consequence:** Systematic approach reveals espionage timeline and calibration requirements.
   - **Dialogue:** Helix: "Good instincts. Calibration and investigation go hand in hand. And right now, someone's protocols are about to get very interesting."

2. **Y (Optimus):** "Analyze the calibration anomalies statistically."
   - **Consequence:** Statistical analysis reveals the reality fracture patterns and espionage methods.
   - **Dialogue:** Optimus: "The calibration patterns... they're not random. Probability of Gasket's past involvement: 68.4%."

3. **Z (ZTech):** "Deploy calibration analysis drones. Tech to the rescue!"
   - **Consequence:** Drones stabilize the compass but also accidentally trigger security alerts.
   - **Dialogue:** ZTech: "My drones work perfectly! Except for the one that started analyzing employee data. But hey, we got the calibration!"

4. **G (Gasket):** "Trust the compass - the calibration anomalies show the real fractures."
   - **Consequence:** Compass reveals the espionage is connected to Gasket's mysterious incident.
   - **Dialogue:** Gasket: (haunted voice) "The calibration blues... they're not just technical. The compass remembers the fractures."

## Scene 2: Espionage Exposure & Confrontation (2 minutes)

**Background:** Data center with calibration equipment, server arrays, and security systems. Reality fracture points and hidden data caches for action sequences.

**Narrative:** The confrontation reveals the espionage suspect's role in the data breach. The Crimson Compass detects calibration anomalies that expose reality fractures from Gasket's past.

**Puzzle:** Breach Containment & Fracture Analysis
- **Objective:** Contain data breach while analyzing reality fracture patterns
- **Mechanics:** Secure compromised systems, decode fracture signatures, identify trauma connections
- **Solution:** Breach contained, fracture patterns reveal Gasket's past incident connections
- **Clue:** Calibration anomalies match patterns from Gasket's mysterious trauma

**Environmental Interaction:** Data Center Chase - Treasure Hunting Pursuit
- **Choice:** Pursue suspect directly vs. secure calibration data first
- **Consequence:** Direct pursuit captures suspect but allows data loss; securing data first reveals fracture evidence
- **Cinematic Element:** Dynamic pursuit through data center with climbing and environmental puzzles

**Dialogue:**

**Espionage Suspect:** (defensive, backing against server rack) "I was just following orders! The calibration issues... they're not my fault!"

**Helix:** "Oh sweetie, 'not my fault' data breaches? That's like saying a virus is just a friendly visitor. Now, about those reality fracture patterns..."

**Optimus:** "Fracture analysis shows calibration interference. Probability of past trauma connection: 81.2%. Most... revealing."

**ZTech:** "Their breach is child's play! I could contain it with this interface! It also plays music and predicts the weather!"

**Gasket:** (appearing urgently, fragmented) "The fractures... they're not just anomalies. Someone's testing calibration limits. The compass sees the breach."

**Espionage Suspect:** (breaking down) "The patterns... they were everywhere! I didn't create them! Someone else did!"

**Helix:** "And that's exactly what we're going to find out. Now, about those espionage contacts..."

## Scene 3: Resolution (1 minute)

**Background:** Calibration lab with stabilized compass, breach evidence displays, and team debrief setup.

**Narrative:** The espionage operation is exposed and data breach contained, but the compass reveals disturbing calibration anomalies.

**Case Closure (95%):** Espionage operation exposed, data breach contained, immediate threat neutralized.

**Shadow Unease (5%):** Compass calibration reveals Gasket's past trauma echoes suggesting deeper personal connections.

**Team Debrief:**

**Helix:** "Well handled, Player. Though I could do without the holographic warnings from our spectral companion."

**Optimus:** "Disturbing calibration patterns. The reality fractures suggest Gasket's past involvement. Most... concerning."

**ZTech:** "My stabilizer worked perfectly! Except for the coffee brewing. And the weather predictions. But the breach? Contained!"

**Gasket:** (fading, haunted) "The calibration... it's just the beginning. The fractures... they go deeper than you know."

**Epilogue Hook:** The calibration anomalies hint at Gasket's mysterious incident, suggesting the team's compass training will uncover more about their spectral companion's past.
