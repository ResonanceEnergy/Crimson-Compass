## Scene 1: Puzzle Calibration Setup (2 minutes)

**Background:** Corporate research lab with puzzle mechanism prototypes, calibration stations, and anomaly detection systems. Puzzle interfaces and testing chambers for investigative approaches.

**Narrative:** The team investigates sabotage in prototype puzzle mechanisms while calibrating the Crimson Compass. The compass detects deception fields in puzzle anomalies suggesting systematic testing.

**Compass Mini-Puzzle:** Puzzle Anomaly Detection - Deception Field Calibration
- **Objective:** Use compass to detect and calibrate puzzle anomalies during sabotage investigation
- **Mechanics:** Scan puzzle mechanisms for deception fields, identify sabotage patterns, stabilize compass readings
- **Solution:** Anomaly detection reveals sabotage methods and calibration improvements
- **Reward:** Access to enhanced puzzle-solving capabilities and sabotage evidence

**Treasure Hunting Element:** Lab Investigation - Mechanism Hunt
- **Choice:** Direct puzzle mechanism examination vs. compass-guided anomaly search
- **Consequence:** Direct examination yields mechanism relics but risks triggering sabotage; compass search reveals systematic testing evidence

**Dialogue:**

**Helix:** "Puzzle practice and calibration time. Remember: this is compass mastery training, not a game show. ZTech, no experimental puzzle solvers that turn the lab into a disco. Optimus, puzzle anomalies aren't just statistical outliers."

**Optimus:** "Anomaly detection initiated. Probability of systematic sabotage: 72.4%. These puzzle patterns... they suggest deliberate testing."

**ZTech:** "Their sabotage is laughable! Check this puzzle solver I built - it also predicts puzzle solutions and brews coffee! Maximum absurdity, maximum function!"

**Gasket:** (sudden holographic appearance, urgent) "Patterns... they're systematic. Dangerous. The compass sees the deception... sabotage ghosts in the mechanisms."

**Player Choice Options:**

1. **X (Helix):** "Coordinate team calibration protocols and puzzle examination."
   - **Consequence:** Systematic calibration reveals sabotage timeline and mechanism vulnerabilities.
   - **Dialogue:** Helix: "Good coordination. Puzzles and sabotages need careful handling. And right now, someone's mechanisms are about to get very calibrated."

2. **Y (Optimus):** "Analyze the puzzle anomaly patterns statistically."
   - **Consequence:** Statistical analysis reveals the sabotage methodology and testing patterns.
   - **Dialogue:** Optimus: "The anomaly patterns... they're not random. Probability of coordinated testing: 85.6%."

3. **Z (ZTech):** "Deploy puzzle analysis drones. Tech to the rescue!"
   - **Consequence:** Drones analyze mechanisms but also accidentally trigger calibration alerts.
   - **Dialogue:** ZTech: "My drones work perfectly! Except for the one that started solving puzzles autonomously. But hey, we got the sabotage!"

4. **G (Gasket):** "Trust the compass - the puzzle anomalies show the real deception fields."
   - **Consequence:** Compass reveals the sabotage is part of systematic compass countermeasure testing.
   - **Dialogue:** Gasket: (haunted voice) "The practice... it's not just puzzles. The compass remembers these deception scars."

## Scene 2: Sabotage Confrontation & Calibration (2 minutes)

**Background:** Puzzle testing chamber with mechanism interfaces, calibration equipment, and sabotage evidence. Hidden compartments and emergency protocols for action sequences.

**Narrative:** The confrontation reveals the saboteur testing compass countermeasures through puzzle mechanisms. The Crimson Compass detects systematic deception field patterns.

**Puzzle:** Mechanism Security & Anomaly Analysis
- **Objective:** Secure puzzle mechanisms while analyzing sabotage anomaly patterns
- **Mechanics:** Protect prototype systems, decode deception signatures, identify testing methodologies
- **Solution:** Mechanisms secured, anomaly patterns reveal systematic countermeasure testing
- **Clue:** Deception fields match patterns from organized sabotage operations

**Environmental Interaction:** Chamber Chase - Puzzle Pursuit
- **Choice:** Pursue saboteur directly vs. secure mechanism data first
- **Consequence:** Direct pursuit captures saboteur but allows mechanism damage; securing data first reveals testing evidence
- **Cinematic Element:** Dynamic pursuit through testing chamber with climbing and environmental puzzles

**Dialogue:**

**Saboteur:** (defensive, backing against mechanism console) "I was just testing the systems! The puzzle mechanisms... they're vulnerable to compass interference!"

**Helix:** "Oh sweetie, 'vulnerable' puzzle mechanisms? That's like saying a lock is just a fancy doorknob. Now, about those deception field patterns..."

**Optimus:** "Pattern analysis shows systematic interference. Probability of countermeasure testing: 91.2%. Most... concerning."

**ZTech:** "Their sabotage is child's play! I could secure it with this interface! It also plays music and predicts the weather!"

**Gasket:** (appearing urgently, fragmented) "The patterns... they're not just mechanisms. Someone's testing compass limits. The compass sees the countermeasures."

**Saboteur:** (breaking down) "The testing... it was systematic! I didn't create it! Someone else did!"

**Helix:** "And that's exactly what we're calibrating against. Now, about those countermeasure contacts..."

## Scene 3: Resolution (1 minute)

**Background:** Lab calibration center with secured mechanisms, anomaly displays, and team debrief setup.

**Narrative:** The sabotage is thwarted and mechanisms secured, but the compass reveals systematic countermeasure testing patterns.

**Case Closure (95%):** Sabotage thwarted; puzzle mechanisms secured, immediate threat neutralized.

**Shadow Unease (5%):** Puzzle anomalies suggest systematic testing of compass countermeasures.

**Team Debrief:**

**Helix:** "Well handled, Player. Though I could do without the holographic warnings from our spectral companion."

**Optimus:** "Disturbing anomaly patterns. The systematic testing suggests countermeasure development. Most... concerning."

**ZTech:** "My puzzle solver worked perfectly! Except for the coffee brewing. And the weather predictions. But the sabotage? Thwarted!"

**Gasket:** (fading, haunted) "The patterns... they're just the beginning. The countermeasures... they go deeper than you know."

**Epilogue Hook:** The systematic countermeasure testing hints at organized opposition to compass technology, suggesting Season 2 will explore larger technological conflicts.
