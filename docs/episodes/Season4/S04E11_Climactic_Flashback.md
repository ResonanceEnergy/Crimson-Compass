- **Flashback Guardian:** Late 30s, protective curator in armored uniform, safeguarding traumatic artifacts
- **Memory Stabilizer:** Mid-20s, empathetic technician with flashback devices, managing trauma containment

## Scene 1: Memory Theft Investigation (2 minutes)

**Background:** Memory vault with flashback artifacts, manipulation devices, and trauma containment fields. Memory echoes and incident displays create haunting visual effects.

**Narrative:** The team investigates a memory artifact theft using flashback manipulation technology. The Crimson Compass detects traumatic patterns revealing connections to Gasket's incident.

**Compass Mini-Puzzle:** Traumatic Memory Mapping - Incident Detection
- **Objective:** Use compass to map traumatic memories and detect incident locations
- **Mechanics:** Trace flashback pathways, identify manipulation signatures, stabilize memory readings
- **Solution:** Memory mapping reveals theft methods and incident connections
- **Reward:** Access to enhanced traumatic capabilities and incident intelligence

**Treasure Hunting Element:** Vault Exploration - Flashback Hunt
- **Choice:** Direct theft investigation vs. compass-guided traumatic exploration
- **Consequence:** Direct investigation yields memory artifacts but risks missing flashback evidence; traumatic exploration reveals incident connection hints

**Dialogue:**

**Helix:** "Memory artifact investigation and traumatic pattern analysis. Remember: this is sensitive flashback work, not a therapy session. ZTech, no experimental memory detectors that turn the vault into a nightmare simulator. Optimus, traumatic patterns aren't just statistical visualizations."

**Optimus:** "Memory analysis initiated. Probability of incident interference: 89.5%. These flashback patterns... they suggest trauma-level operations."

**ZTech:** "Their theft is laughable! Check this detector I built - it also predicts flashbacks and brews coffee! Maximum absurdity, maximum memory clarity!"

**Gasket:** (sudden holographic appearance, distressed) "Patterns... they're not just memories. Dangerous. The compass sees the incident... my traumas awakening."

**Player Choice Options:**

1. **X (Helix):** "Coordinate flashback investigation procedures and traumatic analysis."
   - **Consequence:** Systematic investigation reveals theft timeline and incident connection patterns.
   - **Dialogue:** Helix: "Good coordination. Flashbacks and traumatic incidents need careful handling. And right now, someone's manipulation operations are about to get very analyzed."

2. **Y (Optimus):** "Analyze the traumatic memory patterns statistically."
   - **Consequence:** Statistical analysis reveals the theft structure and incident connection correlations.
   - **Dialogue:** Optimus: "The flashback patterns... they're perfectly orchestrated. Probability of deliberate incident connection: 94.8%."

3. **Z (ZTech):** "Deploy traumatic memory drones. Tech to the rescue!"
   - **Consequence:** Drones map memories but also accidentally trigger vault alert systems.
   - **Dialogue:** ZTech: "My drones work perfectly! Except for the one that started detecting flashbacks autonomously. But hey, we got the vault!"

4. **G (Gasket):** "Trust the compass - the traumatic memories show the real incident fractures."
   - **Consequence:** Compass reveals the flashbacks expose connections to Gasket's incident.
   - **Dialogue:** Gasket: (haunted voice) "The memory... it's not just flashback. The compass remembers the incident scars."

## Scene 2: Theft Confrontation & Incident Analysis (2 minutes)

**Background:** Memory chamber with theft equipment, flashback devices, and incident displays. Hidden trauma pathways and emergency protocols for action sequences.

**Narrative:** The confrontation reveals the memory theft using flashback technology to access traumatic artifacts. The Crimson Compass detects memory patterns indicating deeper incident layers.

**Puzzle:** Vault Security & Traumatic Analysis
- **Objective:** Secure theft operation while analyzing incident patterns
- **Mechanics:** Manipulate flashback fields, decode memory signatures, identify incident connections
- **Solution:** Operation secured, traumatic patterns reveal Gasket's incident
- **Clue:** Memory patterns match signatures from incident-level operations

**Environmental Interaction:** Chamber Chase - Incident Pursuit
- **Choice:** Pursue thief directly vs. secure incident data first
- **Consequence:** Direct pursuit captures thief but allows field reactivation; securing data first reveals complete incident intelligence
- **Cinematic Element:** Dynamic pursuit through flashback fields with climbing and environmental puzzles

**Dialogue:**

**Memory Thief:** (defensive, backing against flashback console) "The traumatic memories protect us! The incidents... they're ours to access!"

**Helix:** "Oh sweetie, 'protective' traumatic memories? That's like saying a scar is just a fancy wound. Now, about those incident connections..."

**Optimus:** "Memory analysis shows incident interference. Probability of trauma connection: 97.2%. Most... concerning."

**ZTech:** "Their theft is child's play! I could secure it with this analyzer! It also plays music and predicts the weather!"

**Gasket:** (appearing urgently, fragmented) "The patterns... they're not just memories. Someone's accessing incident realities. The compass sees the traumas."

**Memory Thief:** (breaking down) "The artifacts... they were everywhere! I didn't create them! Someone else did!"

**Helix:** "And that's exactly what we've analyzed. Now, about those incident contacts..."

## Scene 3: Resolution (1 minute)

**Background:** Vault sanctuary with recovered artifacts, incident displays, and team debrief setup.

**Narrative:** The memory theft is stopped and flashback artifacts recovered, but the compass reveals traumatic incident details.

**Case Closure (95%):** Theft operation stopped; flashback artifacts recovered, immediate threat neutralized.

**Shadow Unease (5%):** Flashback reveals traumatic incident details.

**Team Debrief:**

**Helix:** "Well handled, Player. Though I could do without the holographic distress from our spectral companion."

**Optimus:** "Disturbing flashback patterns. The incident connections suggest trauma-level involvement. Most... concerning."

**ZTech:** "My memory detector worked perfectly! Except for the coffee brewing. And the weather predictions. But the incidents? Analyzed!"

**Gasket:** (fading, haunted) "The patterns... they're just the beginning. The traumatic incidents... they go deeper than you know."

**Season Arc Hook:** The incident details hint at the full truth of what broke Gasket, setting up Season 4's climactic confrontation.
