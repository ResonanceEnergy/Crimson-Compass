- **Artifact Curator:** Early 50s, protective guardian in armored uniform, safeguarding dangerous artifacts
- **Trauma Specialist:** Mid-20s, empathetic technician with trauma scanners, managing incident containment

## Scene 1: Smuggling Ring Investigation (2 minutes)

**Background:** Hidden warehouse with trauma artifacts, manipulation devices, and incident containment fields. Trauma scanners and memory displays create haunting visual effects.

**Narrative:** The team investigates an artifact smuggling ring using trauma manipulation technology. The Crimson Compass detects trauma patterns revealing connections to Gasket's incident.

**Compass Mini-Puzzle:** Trauma Pattern Mapping - Incident Detection
- **Objective:** Use compass to map trauma patterns and detect incident locations
- **Mechanics:** Trace trauma pathways, identify manipulation signatures, stabilize memory readings
- **Solution:** Trauma mapping reveals smuggling methods and incident connections
- **Reward:** Access to enhanced trauma capabilities and incident intelligence

**Treasure Hunting Element:** Warehouse Exploration - Trauma Hunt
- **Choice:** Direct smuggling investigation vs. compass-guided trauma exploration
- **Consequence:** Direct investigation yields smuggling artifacts but risks missing trauma evidence; trauma exploration reveals incident connection hints

**Dialogue:**

**Helix:** "Artifact smuggling investigation and trauma pattern analysis. Remember: this is sensitive trauma work, not a therapy session. ZTech, no experimental trauma detectors that turn the warehouse into a haunted house. Optimus, trauma patterns aren't just statistical visualizations."

**Optimus:** "Trauma analysis initiated. Probability of incident interference: 87.4%. These trauma patterns... they suggest personal-level operations."

**ZTech:** "Their smuggling is laughable! Check this detector I built - it also predicts trauma and brews coffee! Maximum absurdity, maximum trauma clarity!"

**Gasket:** (sudden holographic appearance, distressed) "Patterns... they're not just trauma. Dangerous. The compass sees the incident... my memories awakening."

**Player Choice Options:**

1. **X (Helix):** "Coordinate trauma investigation procedures and incident analysis."
   - **Consequence:** Systematic investigation reveals smuggling timeline and incident connection patterns.
   - **Dialogue:** Helix: "Good coordination. Trauma and personal incidents need careful handling. And right now, someone's manipulation operations are about to get very analyzed."

2. **Y (Optimus):** "Analyze the trauma pattern correlations statistically."
   - **Consequence:** Statistical analysis reveals the smuggling structure and incident connection correlations.
   - **Dialogue:** Optimus: "The trauma patterns... they're perfectly orchestrated. Probability of deliberate incident connection: 92.6%."

3. **Z (ZTech):** "Deploy trauma pattern drones. Tech to the rescue!"
   - **Consequence:** Drones map trauma but also accidentally trigger warehouse alert systems.
   - **Dialogue:** ZTech: "My drones work perfectly! Except for the one that started detecting trauma autonomously. But hey, we got the warehouse!"

4. **G (Gasket):** "Trust the compass - the trauma patterns show the real incident fractures."
   - **Consequence:** Compass reveals the trauma exposes connections to Gasket's incident.
   - **Dialogue:** Gasket: (haunted voice) "The trauma... it's not just patterns. The compass remembers the incident scars."

## Scene 2: Smuggling Confrontation & Incident Analysis (2 minutes)

**Background:** Artifact vault with smuggling equipment, trauma devices, and incident displays. Hidden memory pathways and emergency protocols for action sequences.

**Narrative:** The confrontation reveals the smuggling ring using trauma technology to transport dangerous artifacts. The Crimson Compass detects trauma patterns indicating deeper incident layers.

**Puzzle:** Warehouse Security & Trauma Analysis
- **Objective:** Secure smuggling ring while analyzing incident patterns
- **Mechanics:** Manipulate trauma fields, decode smuggling signatures, identify incident connections
- **Solution:** Ring secured, trauma patterns reveal Gasket's incident
- **Clue:** Trauma patterns match signatures from incident-level operations

**Environmental Interaction:** Vault Chase - Incident Pursuit
- **Choice:** Pursue smuggler directly vs. secure incident data first
- **Consequence:** Direct pursuit captures smuggler but allows field reactivation; securing data first reveals complete incident intelligence
- **Cinematic Element:** Dynamic pursuit through trauma fields with climbing and environmental puzzles

**Dialogue:**

**Trauma Smuggler:** (defensive, backing against trauma console) "The trauma patterns protect us! The incidents... they're ours to access!"

**Helix:** "Oh sweetie, 'protective' trauma patterns? That's like saying a nightmare is just a fancy dream. Now, about those incident connections..."

**Optimus:** "Trauma analysis shows incident interference. Probability of personal connection: 95.8%. Most... concerning."

**ZTech:** "Their smuggling is child's play! I could secure it with this analyzer! It also plays music and predicts the weather!"

**Gasket:** (appearing urgently, fragmented) "The patterns... they're not just trauma. Someone's accessing incident realities. The compass sees the memories."

**Trauma Smuggler:** (breaking down) "The artifacts... they were everywhere! I didn't create them! Someone else did!"

**Helix:** "And that's exactly what we've analyzed. Now, about those incident contacts..."

## Scene 3: Resolution (1 minute)

**Background:** Warehouse security area with contained trauma, incident displays, and team debrief setup.

**Narrative:** The smuggling ring is dismantled and trauma artifacts contained, but the compass reveals deeper connections to Gasket's incident.

**Case Closure (95%):** Smuggling ring dismantled; trauma artifacts contained, immediate threat neutralized.

**Shadow Unease (5%):** Trauma investigation reveals Gasket's incident connections.

**Team Debrief:**

**Helix:** "Well handled, Player. Though I could do without the holographic distress from our spectral companion."

**Optimus:** "Disturbing trauma patterns. The incident connections suggest personal-level involvement. Most... concerning."

**ZTech:** "My trauma detector worked perfectly! Except for the coffee brewing. And the weather predictions. But the incidents? Analyzed!"

**Gasket:** (fading, haunted) "The patterns... they're just the beginning. The trauma incidents... they go deeper than you know."

**Season Arc Hook:** The incident connections hint at the traumatic event that broke Gasket, setting up Season 4's exploration of the compass master's downfall.
