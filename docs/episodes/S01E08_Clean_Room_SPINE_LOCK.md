- **Security Guard:** Early 40s, uniform, radio, competent but overwhelmed by the situation
- **Maintenance Technician:** Mid-30s, coveralls, tool belt, knows the facility systems intimately

## Scene 1: Facility Breach Investigation (2 minutes)

**Background:** High-tech clean room facility with airlocks, decontamination showers, and prototype labs. Biological contamination creating interference patterns. Ventilation systems and service corridors for stealth approaches.

**Narrative:** The team investigates a compromised clean room where prototype contamination has occurred. The Crimson Compass detects contamination signatures, with Gasket's memories surfacing about similar biological breaches.

**Compass Mini-Puzzle:** Contamination Signature Mapping - Anomaly Detection
- **Objective:** Use compass to detect biological contamination patterns in the facility
- **Mechanics:** Scan facility for contamination signatures, identify breach points, trace anomaly clusters
- **Solution:** Contamination patterns reveal breach location and contamination spread routes
- **Reward:** Access to hidden contamination samples and facility access logs

**Treasure Hunting Element:** Facility Exploration - Relic Collection
- **Choice:** Direct airlock access vs. service corridor infiltration
- **Consequence:** Airlock access yields contamination relics but risks spreading contamination; service corridor reveals maintenance tampering evidence

**Dialogue:**

**Helix:** "Alright team, suit up and remember: this is a clean room, not a mud wrestling pit. ZTech, no experimenting with the decontamination showers. Optimus, try not to confuse the contamination scanner with a metal detector."

**Optimus:** "Contamination signatures detected. Probability of deliberate breach: 82.4%. This biological agent... it's not standard. Someone's been very thorough."

**ZTech:** "Their security is full of holes! Check this contamination detector I built - it also brews coffee and predicts when it'll rain! Maximum absurdity, maximum function!"

**Gasket:** (sudden holographic appearance, urgent) "Not thorough. Dangerous. The compass sees the patterns... biological ghosts in the air."

**Player Choice Options:**

1. **X (Helix):** "Coordinate decontamination protocols and team safety measures."
   - **Consequence:** Proper protocols reveal contamination logs and breach timeline.
   - **Dialogue:** Helix: "Good instincts. Safety first, questions later. And right now, someone's safety protocols are about to get audited."

2. **Y (Optimus):** "Analyze the contamination patterns statistically."
   - **Consequence:** Statistical analysis reveals the biological agent's structure and origin.
   - **Dialogue:** Optimus: "The contamination patterns... they're not random. Probability of engineered agent: 94.1%."

3. **Z (ZTech):** "Deploy contamination analysis drones. Tech to the rescue!"
   - **Consequence:** Drones scan the facility but also accidentally trigger emergency containment protocols.
   - **Dialogue:** ZTech: "My drones work perfectly! Except for the one that started analyzing air quality. But hey, we got the contamination!"

4. **G (Gasket):** "Trust the compass - the contamination anomalies show the real breach."
   - **Consequence:** Compass reveals the contamination was introduced during prototype development.
   - **Dialogue:** Gasket: (haunted voice) "The clean room... it's not clean. The compass remembers these biological scars."

## Scene 2: Containment & Confrontation (2 minutes)

**Background:** Clean room interior with prototype equipment, contamination zones, and emergency systems. Hidden compartments and ventilation access for action sequences.

**Narrative:** The confrontation reveals the research scientist was coerced into introducing the contamination. The Crimson Compass detects biological anomaly samples that suggest a larger sabotage operation.

**Puzzle:** Contamination Containment & Sample Analysis
- **Objective:** Contain biological contamination while analyzing anomaly samples
- **Mechanics:** Seal contamination zones, analyze sample signatures, identify sabotage patterns
- **Solution:** Contamination contained, samples reveal coordinated biological warfare operation
- **Clue:** Biological signatures match military research patterns, samples show weaponization attempts

**Environmental Interaction:** Facility Chase - Treasure Hunting Pursuit
- **Choice:** Pursue scientist directly vs. secure samples first
- **Consequence:** Direct pursuit captures scientist but allows sample destruction; securing samples first reveals additional contamination evidence
- **Cinematic Element:** Dynamic pursuit through airlocks and decontamination zones with climbing and environmental puzzles

**Dialogue:**

**Research Scientist:** (panicked, in protective gear) "I didn't have a choice! They threatened my research funding! The contamination was supposed to be contained!"

**Helix:** "Oh sweetie, 'contained' biological agents in a clean room? That's like saying a volcano is just a warm hill. Now, about those anomaly samples..."

**Optimus:** "Sample analysis shows biological weapon patterns. Probability of state-sponsored sabotage: 87.9%. Most... alarming."

**ZTech:** "Their containment is child's play! I could seal it with this wrench! It also tightens bolts and predicts the weather!"

**Gasket:** (appearing urgently, fragmented) "The samples... they're not just contamination. Someone's testing biological limits. The compass sees the breach."

**Research Scientist:** (breaking down) "The samples... they were in the prototype! We didn't create them! Someone else did!"

**Helix:** "And that's exactly what we're going to find out. Now, about those sabotage contacts..."

## Scene 3: Resolution (1 minute)

**Background:** Facility decontamination area with secured samples, evidence displays, and team debrief setup.

**Narrative:** The facility is secured and contamination contained, but the compass reveals disturbing biological anomalies.

**Case Closure (95%):** Facility secured, contamination contained, immediate sabotage operation dismantled.

**Shadow Unease (5%):** Biological anomaly samples appear in multiple facilities. The compass detects contamination signatures suggesting a coordinated biological warfare network.

**Team Debrief:**

**Helix:** "Well handled, Player. Though I could do without the holographic warnings from our haunted colleague."

**Optimus:** "Disturbing biological patterns. The anomaly samples suggest sophisticated sabotage. Most... concerning."

**ZTech:** "My contamination detector worked perfectly! Except for the coffee brewing. And the weather predictions. But the facility? Secured!"

**Gasket:** (fading, haunted) "The samples... they're just the beginning. The biological breaches... they go deeper than you know."

**Epilogue Hook:** The biological anomaly samples trace back to a military research program using advanced contamination techniques. The pattern suggests someone is developing biological weapons under the guise of legitimate research.
