# S01E08: Custody

## Episode Overview
**Title:** Custody  
**Case:** Encrypted design files theft  
**Case Token:** Files recovered; breach contained  
**Shadow Token:** Vault track with no authorizing signature  
**Theme:** Digital security, encryption, evidence handling  

## Character Descriptions

### Player (The Closer)
- **Appearance:** Focused on technical displays, determined expression
- **Background:** Mastering digital investigation techniques
- **Personality:** Patient with complex technical challenges

### Advisors
- **Helix:** Coordinating with legal and technical teams
- **Optimus:** Encryption analysis and pattern recognition
- **ZTech:** Breach investigation and recovery
- **Gasket:** Not present

### NPCs
- **Security Director:** Mid-50s, defensive, corporate attire
- **Encryption Expert:** Early 40s, brilliant, disheveled
- **Legal Counsel:** Late 30s, precise, briefcase
- **Thief:** Mid-20s, skilled, captured but smug

## Scene 1: Vault Breach

**Background:** High-security data vault, reinforced doors, biometric scanners. Status displays, security cameras.

**Narrative:** The breach occurred in a secure data vault. The files were encrypted but the thief had the keys.

**Puzzle:** Access Log Reconstruction  
- **Objective:** Trace the breach entry method  
- **Mechanics:** Log analysis, biometric verification  
- **Solution:** Authorized credentials used at unauthorized time  
- **Clue:** Timestamp manipulation in access records

**Dialogue:**

**Security Director:** "Impossible! Our vault is impenetrable."

**ZTech:** "Impenetrable? Buddy, I could crack this with a paperclip and optimism."

**Encryption Expert:** "The encryption is military-grade. Without the keys..."

## Scene 2: File Recovery

**Background:** Secure operations center, multiple workstations, data recovery equipment. Urgent atmosphere.

**Narrative:** The files have been partially decrypted, revealing the scope of the theft. Custody procedures must be followed precisely.

**Puzzle:** Decryption Sequence  
- **Objective:** Complete file recovery without corruption  
- **Mechanics:** Multi-stage decryption, integrity verification  
- **Solution:** Parallel processing recovers all files  
- **Clue:** Backup fragments contain recovery keys

**Dialogue:**

**Legal Counsel:** "We must maintain chain of custody. One wrong step and evidence is inadmissible."

**Optimus:** "Probability of full recovery: 94%. Adjusting decryption parameters."

**Helix:** "Keep it together, people. We're almost there."

## Puzzles & Mechanics
