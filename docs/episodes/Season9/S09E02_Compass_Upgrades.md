# S09E02: Compass Upgrades

## Episode Overview
**SPINE LOCK Compliance:** This episode fully implements SPINE LOCK design standards with standardized character ensemble (Player as Compass Master, Optimus as Bumbling Boomer Executive, Helix as Big Sister Administrative Glue, ZTech as Nerd Soldier Tech Genius, Gasket as Broken Prodigy), Crimson Compass quantum navigation mechanics (pirate-tech aesthetic with evolving AI), dual narrative system (95% closure/5% unease), and Futurama Detective Noir + Uncharted Action-Adventure visual fusion.

**Case:** The team implements specific upgrades to the evolved Crimson Compass, enhancing its capabilities while learning that upgrades require careful calibration and testing.

**Tokens:** Upgrade tokens enhance compass functionality, but reveal that improvements create new complexity and potential failure points.

**Theme:** Upgrades enhance capability but increase complexity - power grows alongside the challenges of mastering it.

**Duration:** 5-minute micro-episode with integrated compass mini-puzzles and treasure hunting elements.
