## Scene 1: Stakeout Introduction

**Background:** Urban rooftop overlooking corporate headquarters at dusk. City lights twinkle, rain-slicked streets below. Construction crane in distance.

**Narrative:** You arrive at the stakeout location just as the target emerges from the building. The street is quiet, too quiet. Your informant mentioned unusual activity, but this seems... wrong.

**Dialogue:**

**Helix:** "Welcome to the team, Closer. I'm Helix - I keep these cowboys from killing each other. Or themselves."

**Optimus:** "Target acquired. Movement pattern suggests evasion training. Probability of armed resistance: 23%."

**ZTech:** "Ooh, check this thermal scan! The building's hotter than it should be. Prototype cooling system maybe?"

**Player Choice Options:**

1. **X (Helix):** "Maintain distance and observe. Patience is key in surveillance."
   - **Consequence:** You hold back, watching from the shadows. The target seems nervous, constantly checking surroundings.
   - **Dialogue:** Helix: "Good call. Let them show their hand first."

2. **Y (Optimus):** "Get closer for a better look. Risk assessment shows acceptable danger."
   - **Consequence:** You move in closer, using the crowd for cover. The target spots something suspicious and picks up pace.
   - **Dialogue:** Optimus: "Movement detected. Adjusting trajectory."

3. **Z (ZTech):** "Call in backup immediately. Better safe than sorry."
   - **Consequence:** You radio for immediate support. The response team arrives quickly, but the target has already slipped away.
   - **Dialogue:** ZTech: "Backup's here! Wait, where'd they go?"

4. **G (Gasket):** "Trust your gut - this setup smells like a trap. Abort and regroup."
   - **Consequence:** You pull back immediately. Moments later, you see figures moving in the shadows - you made the right call.
   - **Dialogue:** Gasket: "Not like this. Never like this."

## Scene 2: Confrontation

**Background:** Abandoned warehouse district. Dim streetlights, puddles reflecting neon signs. Chain-link fences, graffiti-covered walls.

**Narrative:** The target leads you to an abandoned warehouse district. Multiple vehicles are parked suspiciously, and you can hear muffled voices from inside one of the buildings.

**Puzzle:** Vehicle Identification  
- **Objective:** Match license plates to contractor database  
- **Mechanics:** Examine 3 suspicious vehicles, cross-reference with agency database  
- **Solution:** One vehicle belongs to the target company, others are decoys  
- **Clue:** Partial plate visible, database shows full registration

**Dialogue:**

**Ring Leader:** "You have no idea who you're dealing with. This is bigger than you think."

**Helix:** "Oh honey, we've dealt with bigger. And dumber."

**Optimus:** "Evidence suggests otherwise. Your access logs show 47 unauthorized entries."

**ZTech:** "Their security system? Child's play. I could hack it with a potato."
