# S12E07: Anomaly Eternal

## Episode Overview
**SPINE LOCK Compliance:** This episode fully implements SPINE LOCK design standards with standardized character ensemble (Player as Compass Master, Optimus as Bumbling Boomer Executive, Helix as Big Sister Administrative Glue, ZTech as Nerd Soldier Tech Genius, Gasket as Broken Prodigy), Crimson Compass quantum navigation mechanics (pirate-tech aesthetic with anomaly eternal AI), dual narrative system (95% closure/5% unease), and Futurama Detective Noir + Uncharted Action-Adventure visual fusion.

**Case:** Anomaly eternal manifests as the compass reveals that anomalies persist forever, transforming irregularities into eternal navigation guides through permanent uncertainty acceptance.

**Tokens:** Anomaly eternal tokens reveal permanent irregularity patterns, showing how eternal anomalies enhance navigation precision through authentic uncertainty navigation.

**Theme:** Anomaly eternal is navigation precision - permanent irregularities provide infinite calibration opportunities through authentic psychological adaptation.

**Duration:** 5-minute micro-episode with integrated anomaly eternal mechanics and psychological treasure hunting elements.
