## Scene 1: Facility Defense

**Background:** High-tech research facility, security checkpoints, prototype labs. Sterile environment with armed guards.

**Narrative:** The extraction team is attempting to remove the chip from a research facility. Security systems are being bypassed systematically.

**Puzzle:** Security Bypass Detection  
- **Objective:** Identify and counter bypass methods  
- **Mechanics:** System monitoring, countermeasure deployment  
- **Solution:** Pattern recognition in bypass attempts  
- **Clue:** Similar methods used at other facilities

**Dialogue:**

**Facility Director:** "They're targeting our neural interface prototype. We can't let it fall into the wrong hands."

**Helix:** "Positions set. Nobody moves without my signal."

**Extraction Leader:** "This is just business. Step aside and no one gets hurt."

## Scene 2: Extraction Confrontation

**Background:** Prototype storage vault, reinforced glass, security systems. High-stakes atmosphere.

**Narrative:** The extraction team has reached the perimeter. The chip is in a secure transport case.

**Puzzle:** Transport Case Security  
- **Objective:** Prevent chip removal from facility  
- **Mechanics:** Multi-layer security engagement  
- **Solution:** Containment field deployment  
- **Clue:** Case has hidden anti-tampering features

**Dialogue:**

**Optimus:** "Extraction route predicted. Interception probability: 78%."

**ZTech:** "Deploying countermeasures! Let's see how they like being tracked."

**Prototype Engineer:** "That chip represents years of research. We can't lose it now."
