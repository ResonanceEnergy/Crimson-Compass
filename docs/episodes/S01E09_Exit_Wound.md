**Helix:** "Positions set, team! Nobody moves without my mark. Player, compass readings?"

**Player:** "Compass is mapping their route. They're using standardized exit hardware - same tech I've seen at three other sites. This isn't random; it's coordinated."

**Extraction Leader:** [Over facility intercom, professional and cold] "This is just business. Step aside peacefully and no one gets hurt. We're taking what's ours."

**Optimus:** "Route prediction complete. Interception probability: 78%. Adjusting for their standardized hardware patterns. How quaint - using the same exit tech everywhere. Amateur hour."

**ZTech:** "Deploying countermeasures! Let's see how these corporate goons like being tracked. I've got quantum tags that'll follow them to their mommy's basement."

**Gasket:** [Holographic projection materializes] "Standardized hardware? That's a network tell. Compass should map their entire operation. Don't let them reach the vault - containment is key."

**ZTech:** "Deploying countermeasures! Quantum tags activated. These corporate raiders won't know what hit 'em. I've got tracking sigils that'll haunt their dreams."

**Prototype Engineer:** "That neural interface chip represents five years of breakthrough research! It could help millions with cybernetic integration. We cannot lose it to these thieves!"

**Player:** "Compass shows their exit hardware trying to breach the containment field. Same tech signature as the other sites - this is a coordinated network hit."

**Helix:** "Hold positions! Player, coordinate the containment field. Optimus, predict their escape vectors. ZTech, jam that exit hardware!"

**Extraction Leader:** [Breaching vault door] "Last chance. Hand over the prototype and walk away. This facility's security is already compromised."

**Gasket:** [Holographic form intensifies] "Compromised? Not on my watch. That exit hardware is network-linked. Seal the vault - don't let them establish the connection."

## Episode Resolution

**Case Closure (95%):** Extraction attempt thwarted, neural interface prototype secured in facility containment. Compass-guided defense successfully intercepted the network operation, with extraction team apprehended and standardized exit hardware confiscated.

**Shadow Unease (5%):** The standardized exit hardware pattern suggests a coordinated network of corporate raiders operating across multiple facilities. The compass detected network linkages that extend beyond this single operation.

**Team Debrief:**

**Helix:** "Good work, team. Prototype is secure, raiders are contained. But that network pattern... we need to investigate further."

**Optimus:** "Statistical analysis complete. 95% operational success. However, the 5% network uncertainty requires monitoring of similar facilities."

**ZTech:** "I jammed their hardware good. Those quantum tags will lead us right to their bosses. Network operation? Bring it on."

**Player:** "Compass mapped their entire coordination pattern. This wasn't just theft - it was a network probe. The real question is who they're working for."

**Gasket:** [Holographic form analyzing containment field] "Network probe... testing our defenses. The compass saw the pattern. Stay vigilant - this might be the beginning of something larger."

**Ending Shot:** Containment field hums as compass interface displays: "Case: 95% Resolved. Network Protocol: Active."
