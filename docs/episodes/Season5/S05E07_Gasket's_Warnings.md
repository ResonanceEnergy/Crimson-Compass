- **Trauma Guardian:** Late 40s, protective curator in armored uniform, safeguarding against trauma
- **Warning Neutralizer:** Mid-20s, empathetic technician with warning devices, managing trauma containment

## Scene 1: Artifact Theft Investigation (2 minutes)

**Background:** Hidden vault with theft terminals, warning generators, and trauma containment fields. Warning pathways and memory displays create haunting visual effects.

**Narrative:** The team investigates an artifact theft ring using warning manipulation technology. The Crimson Compass detects warning patterns revealing connections to Gasket's trauma and shadow adversary operations.

**Compass Mini-Puzzle:** Warning Signal Mapping - Trauma Detection
- **Objective:** Use compass to map warning signals and detect trauma locations
- **Mechanics:** Trace warning pathways, identify manipulation signatures, stabilize memory readings
- **Solution:** Warning mapping reveals theft methods and trauma connections
- **Reward:** Access to enhanced warning capabilities and trauma intelligence

**Treasure Hunting Element:** Vault Exploration - Warning Hunt
- **Choice:** Direct theft investigation vs. compass-guided warning exploration
- **Consequence:** Direct investigation yields artifact data but risks missing warning evidence; warning exploration reveals trauma connection hints

**Dialogue:**

**Helix:** "Artifact theft investigation and warning signal analysis. Remember: this is sensitive work, not a fortune telling session. ZTech, no experimental warning detectors that turn the vault into a crystal ball. Optimus, warning signals aren't just statistical visualizations."

**Optimus:** "Warning analysis initiated. Probability of trauma interference: 87.9%. These manipulation patterns... they suggest personal-level operations."

**ZTech:** "Their theft is laughable! Check this detector I built - it also predicts warnings and brews coffee! Maximum absurdity, maximum trauma clarity!"

**Gasket:** (sudden holographic appearance, distressed) "Patterns... they're not just warnings. Dangerous. The compass sees the trauma... my memories awakening."

**Player Choice Options:**

1. **X (Helix):** "Coordinate warning investigation procedures and trauma analysis."
   - **Consequence:** Systematic investigation reveals theft timeline and trauma connection patterns.
   - **Dialogue:** Helix: "Good coordination. Warnings and personal traumas need careful handling. And right now, someone's manipulation operations are about to get very analyzed."

2. **Y (Optimus):** "Analyze the warning signal patterns statistically."
   - **Consequence:** Statistical analysis reveals the theft structure and trauma connection correlations.
   - **Dialogue:** Optimus: "The warning patterns... they're perfectly orchestrated. Probability of deliberate trauma connection: 93.4%."

3. **Z (ZTech):** "Deploy warning signal drones. Tech to the rescue!"
   - **Consequence:** Drones map warnings but also accidentally trigger vault alert systems.
   - **Dialogue:** ZTech: "My drones work perfectly! Except for the one that started detecting warnings autonomously. But hey, we got the vault!"

4. **G (Gasket):** "Trust the compass - the warning signals show the real trauma fractures."
   - **Consequence:** Compass reveals the warnings expose connections to Gasket's trauma.
   - **Dialogue:** Gasket: (haunted voice) "The manipulation... it's not just warning. The compass remembers the trauma scars."

## Scene 2: Theft Confrontation & Trauma Analysis (2 minutes)

**Background:** Memory chamber with theft equipment, warning generators, and trauma displays. Hidden signal pathways and emergency protocols for action sequences.

**Narrative:** The confrontation reveals the theft ring using warning technology to access traumatic artifacts. The Crimson Compass detects warning patterns indicating deeper trauma layers.

**Puzzle:** Vault Security & Warning Analysis
- **Objective:** Secure theft ring while analyzing trauma patterns
- **Mechanics:** Manipulate warning fields, decode signal signatures, identify trauma connections
- **Solution:** Ring secured, warning patterns reveal Gasket's trauma
- **Clue:** Manipulation patterns match signatures from trauma-level operations

**Environmental Interaction:** Chamber Chase - Trauma Pursuit
- **Choice:** Pursue thief directly vs. secure trauma data first
- **Consequence:** Direct pursuit captures thief but allows field reactivation; securing data first reveals complete trauma intelligence
- **Cinematic Element:** Dynamic pursuit through warning fields with climbing and environmental puzzles

**Dialogue:**

**Warning Thief:** (defensive, backing against warning console) "The warning manipulation protects us! The traumas... they're ours to access!"

**Helix:** "Oh sweetie, 'protective' warning manipulation? That's like saying a prophecy is just a fancy prediction. Now, about those trauma connections..."

**Optimus:** "Warning analysis shows trauma interference. Probability of personal connection: 95.7%. Most... concerning."

**ZTech:** "Their theft is child's play! I could secure it with this analyzer! It also plays music and predicts the weather!"

**Gasket:** (appearing urgently, fragmented) "The patterns... they're not just warnings. Someone's accessing trauma realities. The compass sees the memories."

**Warning Thief:** (breaking down) "The artifacts... they were everywhere! I didn't create them! Someone else did!"

**Helix:** "And that's exactly what we've analyzed. Now, about those trauma contacts..."

## Scene 3: Resolution (1 minute)

**Background:** Vault sanctuary with decoded warnings, trauma displays, and team debrief setup.

**Narrative:** The theft ring is dismantled and warning signals decoded, but the compass reveals deeper connections to Gasket's trauma and shadow adversary network.

**Case Closure (95%):** Theft ring dismantled; warning signals decoded, immediate threat neutralized.

**Shadow Unease (5%):** Warning analysis reveals shadow adversary warning network.

**Team Debrief:**

**Helix:** "Well handled, Player. Though I could do without the holographic distress from our spectral companion."

**Optimus:** "Disturbing warning patterns. The trauma connections suggest personal-level involvement. Most... concerning."

**ZTech:** "My manipulation detector worked perfectly! Except for the coffee brewing. And the weather predictions. But the traumas? Analyzed!"

**Gasket:** (fading, haunted) "The patterns... they're just the beginning. The warning traumas... they go deeper than you know."

**Season Arc Hook:** Gasket's warnings hint at the personal stakes in Season 5's network of deception, building toward major character revelations.
