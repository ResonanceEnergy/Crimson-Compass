## Scene 1: Facility Defense Setup (2 minutes)

**Background:** High-tech research facility with neural interface labs, security checkpoints, and prototype storage vaults. Extraction routes and hidden access points for tactical approaches.

**Narrative:** The team defends against a physical extraction attempt while using the Crimson Compass to navigate and predict intruder paths. The compass detects standardized exit hardware patterns suggesting a coordinated network.

**Compass Mini-Puzzle:** Extraction Route Detection - Intruder Path Mapping
- **Objective:** Use compass to detect and map extraction routes during facility defense
- **Mechanics:** Scan for intruder paths, identify extraction patterns, stabilize compass readings
- **Solution:** Route anomalies reveal extraction methods and standardized hardware connections
- **Reward:** Access to hidden security systems and route prediction tools

**Treasure Hunting Element:** Facility Navigation - Security Vault Hunt
- **Choice:** Direct confrontation vs. compass-guided navigation
- **Consequence:** Direct confrontation yields immediate defense but risks missing extraction routes; compass navigation reveals hardware standardization evidence

**Dialogue:**

**Helix:** "Extraction attempt in progress. Remember: this is a defense operation, not a demolition derby. ZTech, no experimental countermeasures that turn the facility into a disco. Optimus, extraction routes aren't just statistical probabilities."

**Optimus:** "Extraction routes detected. Probability of intruder interception: 67.3%. These patterns... they match standardized exit hardware."

**ZTech:** "Their extraction gear is amateur hour! Check this countermeasure I built - it also predicts intruder movements and brews coffee! Maximum absurdity, maximum function!"

**Gasket:** (sudden holographic appearance, urgent) "Routes... they're standardized. Dangerous. The extraction... it reveals the network."

**Player Choice Options:**

1. **X (Helix):** "Coordinate defense protocols and team positioning."
   - **Consequence:** Systematic defense reveals extraction timeline and hardware requirements.
   - **Dialogue:** Helix: "Good coordination. Routes and extractions need careful handling. And right now, someone's hardware is about to get very standardized."

2. **Y (Optimus):** "Analyze the extraction routes statistically."
   - **Consequence:** Statistical analysis reveals the intruder path patterns and network connections.
   - **Dialogue:** Optimus: "The route patterns... they're not random. Probability of coordinated network: 78.9%."

3. **Z (ZTech):** "Deploy security countermeasures. Tech to the rescue!"
   - **Consequence:** Countermeasures stabilize defenses but also accidentally trigger facility alerts.
   - **Dialogue:** ZTech: "My countermeasures work perfectly! Except for the one that started analyzing employee extraction habits. But hey, we got the routes!"

4. **G (Gasket):** "Trust the compass - the extraction routes show the real network fractures."
   - **Consequence:** Compass reveals the extraction is connected to standardized hardware networks.
   - **Dialogue:** Gasket: (haunted voice) "The exit wounds... they're not just physical. The compass remembers the standardized paths."

## Scene 2: Extraction Confrontation & Route Pursuit (2 minutes)

**Background:** Neural interface lab with prototype storage, security systems, and extraction equipment. Route manipulation points and hidden hardware caches for action sequences.

**Narrative:** The confrontation reveals the extraction leader's role in the coordinated network. The Crimson Compass detects standardized exit hardware patterns that expose the larger conspiracy.

**Puzzle:** Extraction Containment & Route Analysis
- **Objective:** Contain extraction attempt while analyzing intruder route patterns
- **Mechanics:** Secure prototype systems, decode route signatures, identify network connections
- **Solution:** Extraction contained, route patterns reveal standardized hardware network
- **Clue:** Route anomalies match patterns from coordinated extraction operations

**Environmental Interaction:** Lab Chase - Route Pursuit
- **Choice:** Pursue extraction leader directly vs. secure prototype first
- **Consequence:** Direct pursuit captures leader but allows prototype damage; securing prototype first reveals network evidence
- **Cinematic Element:** Dynamic pursuit through lab with climbing and environmental puzzles

**Dialogue:**

**Extraction Leader:** (defensive, backing against prototype vault) "I was just following extraction protocols! The routes... they're not my design!"

**Helix:** "Oh honey, 'not my design' extraction routes? That's like saying theft is just creative acquisition. Now, about those standardized hardware patterns..."

**Optimus:** "Route analysis shows extraction interference. Probability of network connection: 84.2%. Most... concerning."

**ZTech:** "Their extraction is child's play! I could contain it with this interface! It also plays music and predicts the weather!"

**Gasket:** (appearing urgently, fragmented) "The routes... they're not just paths. Someone's using standardized hardware. The compass sees the network."

**Extraction Leader:** (breaking down) "The patterns... they were everywhere! I didn't create them! Someone else did!"

**Helix:** "And that's exactly what we're going to find out. Now, about those network contacts..."

## Scene 3: Resolution (1 minute)

**Background:** Prototype vault with secured neural interface chip, route evidence displays, and team debrief setup.

**Narrative:** The extraction attempt is stopped and prototype secured, but the compass reveals disturbing standardized exit hardware patterns.

**Case Closure (95%):** Extraction stopped; chip secured, immediate threat neutralized.

**Shadow Unease (5%):** Exit hardware standardized across unrelated sites suggesting coordinated network.

**Team Debrief:**

**Helix:** "Well handled, Player. Though I could do without the holographic warnings from our spectral companion."

**Optimus:** "Disturbing route patterns. The standardized hardware suggests network coordination. Most... concerning."

**ZTech:** "My countermeasures worked perfectly! Except for the coffee brewing. And the weather predictions. But the extraction? Stopped!"

**Gasket:** (fading, haunted) "The routes... they're just the beginning. The network... they go deeper than you know."

**Epilogue Hook:** The standardized exit hardware patterns hint at a coordinated network, suggesting the team's investigation will uncover larger conspiracy elements.
