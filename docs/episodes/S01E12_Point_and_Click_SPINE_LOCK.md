## Scene 1: Interface Investigation (2 minutes)

**Background:** Software development lab with workstations, interface mockups, and testing stations. Interface anomalies creating interference patterns. Break rooms and server closets for stealth approaches.

**Narrative:** The team investigates a point-and-click interface containing hidden backdoors for data exfiltration. The Crimson Compass detects design anomalies, with Gasket's memories surfacing about similar interface sabotages.

**Compass Mini-Puzzle:** Interface Anomaly Analysis - Anomaly Detection
- **Objective:** Use compass to detect backdoor patterns in interface code
- **Mechanics:** Scan interface for design anomalies, identify manipulation signatures, trace backdoor locations
- **Solution:** Interface anomalies reveal backdoor location and exfiltration routes
- **Reward:** Access to hidden interface code and manipulation evidence

**Treasure Hunting Element:** Lab Exploration - Relic Collection
- **Choice:** Direct workstation access vs. server closet infiltration
- **Consequence:** Workstation access yields interface relics but risks triggering alerts; server closet reveals backdoor implementation evidence

**Dialogue:**

**Helix:** "Alright team, interfaces up and remember: this is software development, not a click-fest. ZTech, no reprogramming the user interfaces. Optimus, try not to confuse the anomaly scanner with a mouse."

**Optimus:** "Interface anomalies detected. Probability of hidden backdoors: 93.2%. This design manipulation... it's not obvious. Someone's been very subtle."

**ZTech:** "Their security is laughable! Check this interface scanner I built - it also brews coffee and predicts when it'll rain! Maximum absurdity, maximum function!"

**Gasket:** (sudden holographic appearance, urgent) "Not subtle. Dangerous. The compass sees the patterns... digital ghosts in the clicks."

**Player Choice Options:**

1. **X (Helix):** "Coordinate with development team for proper testing protocols."
   - **Consequence:** Official access reveals interface logs and anomaly timeline.
   - **Dialogue:** Helix: "Good call. Developers love procedures. And right now, someone's procedures are about to get very interesting."

2. **Y (Optimus):** "Analyze the interface patterns statistically."
   - **Consequence:** Statistical analysis reveals the backdoor's structure and exfiltration methods.
   - **Dialogue:** Optimus: "The interface patterns... they're not random. Probability of state-sponsored sabotage: 91.8%."

3. **Z (ZTech):** "Deploy interface analysis drones. Tech to the rescue!"
   - **Consequence:** Drones scan the interface but also accidentally trigger a system backup.
   - **Dialogue:** ZTech: "My drones work perfectly! Except for the one that started designing new interfaces. But hey, we got the backdoors!"

4. **G (Gasket):** "Trust the compass - the interface anomalies show the real breach."
   - **Consequence:** Compass reveals the backdoors are part of a larger data exfiltration network.
   - **Dialogue:** Gasket: (haunted voice) "The point and click... it's not just interface. The compass remembers these digital scars."

## Scene 2: Backdoor Removal & Confrontation (2 minutes)

**Background:** Development workstation area with interface designs, code repositories, and testing equipment. Hidden compartments and emergency exits for action sequences.

**Narrative:** The confrontation reveals the UI/UX designer was coerced into embedding the backdoors. The Crimson Compass detects interface manipulation patterns that suggest a coordinated sabotage operation.

**Puzzle:** Interface Security & Pattern Analysis
- **Objective:** Remove backdoors while analyzing manipulation patterns
- **Mechanics:** Isolate backdoor code, decode interface anomalies, identify sabotage signatures
- **Solution:** Backdoors removed, patterns reveal coordinated espionage operation
- **Clue:** Interface signatures match foreign intelligence patterns, anomalies show systematic data theft

**Environmental Interaction:** Lab Chase - Treasure Hunting Pursuit
- **Choice:** Pursue designer directly vs. secure code first
- **Consequence:** Direct pursuit captures designer but allows code destruction; securing code first reveals additional backdoor evidence
- **Cinematic Element:** Dynamic pursuit through workstations and server areas with climbing and environmental puzzles

**Dialogue:**

**UI/UX Designer:** (defensive, backing against workstation) "I was just following design requirements! The interface is user-friendly! The backdoors weren't my idea!"

**Helix:** "Oh sweetie, 'user-friendly' interfaces with hidden data exfiltration? That's like saying a trojan horse is just a gift. Now, about those manipulation patterns..."

**Optimus:** "Pattern analysis shows sabotage signatures. Probability of coordinated theft: 89.6%. Most... unethical."

**ZTech:** "Their backdoors are child's play! I could remove them with this stylus! It also draws and predicts the weather!"

**Gasket:** (appearing urgently, fragmented) "The patterns... they're not just interface. Someone's testing design limits. The compass sees the theft."

**UI/UX Designer:** (breaking down) "The patterns... they were in the requirements! We didn't create them! Someone else did!"

**Helix:** "And that's exactly what we're going to find out. Now, about those sabotage contacts..."

## Scene 3: Resolution (1 minute)

**Background:** Development security office with secured interface code, evidence displays, and team debrief setup.

**Narrative:** The interface is secured and backdoors removed, but the compass reveals disturbing design anomalies.

**Case Closure (95%):** Interface secured, backdoors removed, immediate exfiltration operation stopped.

**Shadow Unease (5%):** Interface manipulation patterns appear in multiple software projects. The compass detects design anomalies suggesting a coordinated sabotage network.

**Team Debrief:**

**Helix:** "Well handled, Player. Though I could do without the holographic warnings from our phantom friend."

**Optimus:** "Disturbing interface patterns. The manipulation anomalies suggest sophisticated theft. Most... concerning."

**ZTech:** "My interface scanner worked perfectly! Except for the coffee brewing. And the weather predictions. But the backdoors? Removed!"

**Gasket:** (fading, haunted) "The patterns... they're just the beginning. The design breaches... they go deeper than you know."

**Epilogue Hook:** The interface manipulation patterns trace back to a foreign intelligence service using advanced software sabotage techniques. The pattern suggests someone is building a comprehensive data exfiltration network through user interface design.
