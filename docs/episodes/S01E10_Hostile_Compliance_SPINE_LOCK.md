### NPCs
- **Compliance Auditor:** Mid-40s, suit, briefcase, professional demeanor hiding espionage motives

## Scene 1: Audit Investigation (2 minutes)

**Background:** Corporate boardroom with conference tables, presentation screens, and document stacks. Regulatory manipulation creating interference patterns. Service corridors and executive offices for stealth approaches.

**Narrative:** The team investigates a hostile compliance audit being used as cover for corporate espionage. The Crimson Compass detects compliance anomalies, with Gasket's memories surfacing about similar regulatory manipulations.

**Compass Mini-Puzzle:** Compliance Anomaly Analysis - Anomaly Detection
- **Objective:** Use compass to detect regulatory manipulation patterns in audit documents
- **Mechanics:** Scan audit files for compliance anomalies, identify manipulation signatures, trace regulatory breach patterns
- **Solution:** Compliance anomalies reveal espionage location and manipulation routes
- **Reward:** Access to hidden audit documents and regulatory manipulation evidence

**Treasure Hunting Element:** Corporate Exploration - Relic Collection
- **Choice:** Direct boardroom access vs. service corridor infiltration
- **Consequence:** Boardroom access yields regulatory relics but risks triggering alerts; service corridor reveals audit tampering evidence

**Dialogue:**

**Helix:** "Alright team, suits on and remember: this is corporate espionage, not a tea party. ZTech, no hacking the presentation screens. Optimus, try not to confuse the compliance scanner with a spell checker."

**Optimus:** "Compliance anomalies detected. Probability of hostile audit: 95.8%. This regulatory manipulation... it's not standard. Someone's been very thorough."

**ZTech:** "Their security is laughable! Check this compliance scanner I built - it also brews coffee and predicts when it'll rain! Maximum absurdity, maximum function!"

**Gasket:** (sudden holographic appearance, urgent) "Not thorough. Dangerous. The compass sees the patterns... regulatory ghosts in the documents."

**Player Choice Options:**

1. **X (Helix):** "Coordinate with legal team for proper audit protocols."
   - **Consequence:** Official access reveals audit logs and manipulation timeline.
   - **Dialogue:** Helix: "Good call. Lawyers love paperwork. And right now, someone's paperwork is about to get very interesting."

2. **Y (Optimus):** "Analyze the compliance patterns statistically."
   - **Consequence:** Statistical analysis reveals the manipulation algorithm's structure and origin.
   - **Dialogue:** Optimus: "The compliance patterns... they're not random. Probability of foreign intelligence involvement: 88.3%."

3. **Z (ZTech):** "Deploy document analysis drones. Tech to the rescue!"
   - **Consequence:** Drones scan the audit but also accidentally trigger a document backup system.
   - **Dialogue:** ZTech: "My drones work perfectly! Except for the one that started analyzing coffee preferences. But hey, we got the anomalies!"

4. **G (Gasket):** "Trust the compass - the compliance anomalies show the real breach."
   - **Consequence:** Compass reveals the audit is a cover for systematic data exfiltration.
   - **Dialogue:** Gasket: (haunted voice) "The hostile compliance... it's not just audit. The compass remembers these regulatory scars."

## Scene 2: Espionage Exposure & Confrontation (2 minutes)

**Background:** Executive office with file cabinets, computer terminals, and hidden compartments. Regulatory documents and espionage equipment scattered throughout.

**Narrative:** The confrontation reveals the compliance auditor is actually a corporate spy. The Crimson Compass detects regulatory manipulation patterns that suggest a larger espionage operation.

**Puzzle:** Audit Exposure & Pattern Analysis
- **Objective:** Expose hostile audit while analyzing manipulation patterns
- **Mechanics:** Decode regulatory anomalies, trace espionage signatures, identify manipulation networks
- **Solution:** Audit exposed, patterns reveal coordinated corporate espionage operation
- **Clue:** Regulatory signatures match competitor intelligence patterns, anomalies show systematic data theft

**Environmental Interaction:** Corporate Chase - Treasure Hunting Pursuit
- **Choice:** Pursue auditor directly vs. secure evidence first
- **Consequence:** Direct pursuit captures auditor but allows evidence destruction; securing evidence first reveals additional manipulation patterns
- **Cinematic Element:** Dynamic pursuit through executive offices and conference rooms with climbing and environmental puzzles

**Dialogue:**

**Compliance Auditor:** (defensive, backing against desk) "This is a legitimate audit! You have no right to interfere! The compliance issues are real!"

**Helix:** "Oh sweetie, 'legitimate' hostile audits that steal corporate secrets? That's like saying a fox is just visiting the henhouse. Now, about those manipulation patterns..."

**Optimus:** "Pattern analysis shows espionage signatures. Probability of coordinated theft: 92.1%. Most... unethical."

**ZTech:** "Their manipulation is child's play! I could expose it with this pen! It also writes in invisible ink and predicts the weather!"

**Gasket:** (appearing urgently, fragmented) "The patterns... they're not just compliance. Someone's testing regulatory limits. The compass sees the theft."

**Compliance Auditor:** (breaking down) "The patterns... they were in the system! We didn't create them! Someone else did!"

**Helix:** "And that's exactly what we're going to find out. Now, about those espionage contacts..."

## Scene 3: Resolution (1 minute)

**Background:** Corporate security office with exposed audit documents, evidence displays, and team debrief setup.

**Narrative:** The audit is exposed and the espionage operation dismantled, but the compass reveals disturbing regulatory anomalies.

**Case Closure (95%):** Audit exposed, espionage operation dismantled, immediate corporate theft operation stopped.

**Shadow Unease (5%):** Regulatory manipulation patterns appear in multiple audits. The compass detects compliance anomalies suggesting a coordinated corporate espionage network.

**Team Debrief:**

**Helix:** "Well handled, Player. Though I could do without the holographic warnings from our ethereal colleague."

**Optimus:** "Disturbing regulatory patterns. The manipulation anomalies suggest sophisticated theft. Most... troubling."

**ZTech:** "My compliance scanner worked perfectly! Except for the coffee brewing. And the weather predictions. But the audit? Exposed!"

**Gasket:** (fading, haunted) "The patterns... they're just the beginning. The regulatory breaches... they go deeper than you know."

**Epilogue Hook:** The regulatory manipulation patterns trace back to a competitor using advanced compliance techniques. The pattern suggests someone is building a comprehensive corporate espionage network across multiple industries.
