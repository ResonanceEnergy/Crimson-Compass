### NPCs
- **Facility Manager:** Mid-50s, defensive, lab coat, takes contamination protocols way too seriously
- **Insider (Culprit):** Mid-30s, nervous, maintenance uniform, sweating under the clean suit
- **Quality Control Tech:** Early 40s, detail-oriented, glasses, obsessed with particle counts
- **Security Guard:** Late 30s, by-the-book, uniform, treats everyone like they're radioactive

## Scene 1: Facility Inspection (2 minutes)

**Background:** Sterile clean room with air filtration systems, conveyor belts, inspection stations. Workers in protective gear, monitoring screens. The air shimmers with containment fields that make the Crimson Compass hum with interference. Ventilation shafts and service access points for exploration.

**Narrative:** You've infiltrated the clean room facility where micro-components are manufactured. Suspicious waste containers are being moved out more frequently. The compass detects quantum signature anomalies in the air filtration system, its haunted nature causing brief system glitches that reveal hidden contamination patterns.

**Compass Mini-Puzzle:** Contamination Scan - Quantum Signature Detection
- **Objective:** Use compass to detect hidden component transport through quantum anomaly mapping
- **Mechanics:** Scan air particles for quantum signatures, identify contamination vectors, track relic movement patterns
- **Solution:** Waste containers show elevated quantum readings from prototype components, revealing smuggling routes
- **Reward:** Early detection of smuggling method and access to hidden facility areas

**Treasure Hunting Element:** Clean Room Exploration - Relic Collection
- **Choice:** Follow standard contamination protocols vs. investigate ventilation systems
- **Consequence:** Ventilation exploration yields prototype relics but risks containment breach alerts

**Dialogue:**

**Facility Manager:** (adjusting his clean suit nervously) "This is a secure facility! You can't just walk in here without clearance. Do you know how many air changes per hour we maintain? 47! That's more than a hospital!"

**Helix:** "We have clearance, sir. And we're more concerned about what's leaving than entering. Now, about these waste manifests... they seem a tad... inflated."

**ZTech:** "Whoa, check these air filters! They're calibrated for something extra heavy. Like, carrying-micro-components heavy! Oh, and this contamination detector I built? It also brews coffee and tells jokes. Maximum absurdity!"

**Optimus:** "Particle analysis shows contamination levels 23% above baseline. In my day, we called that 'suspicious.' Today they probably have an app for it."

**Player Choice Options:**

1. **X (Helix):** "Request facility tour and staff interviews. Build trust first."
   - **Consequence:** Staff cooperation reveals nervous behavior from maintenance crew.
   - **Dialogue:** Helix: "People talk when you listen. And right now, someone's sweating more than they should in this clean room."

2. **Y (Optimus):** "Run full contamination analysis. Data never lies."
   - **Consequence:** Scientific analysis confirms component smuggling but triggers facility lockdown.
   - **Dialogue:** Optimus: "The numbers don't lie. Unlike some facility managers with their 'perfect' contamination records."

3. **Z (ZTech):** "Deploy contamination detector drone swarm. Tech to the rescue!"
   - **Consequence:** Drones find hidden compartments but also cause a minor containment breach.
   - **Dialogue:** ZTech: "My drones work perfectly! Except for the one that started reciting Shakespeare. But hey, we got the evidence!"

4. **G (Gasket):** "Trust the compass readings - something's off with that filtration system."
   - **Consequence:** Compass leads to discovering the quantum signature masking technique.
   - **Dialogue:** Gasket: (through compass) "Old trick... hide the valuable in the worthless. But quantum signatures... they always leave echoes."

## Scene 2: Insider Confrontation & Chase (2 minutes)

**Background:** Maintenance corridor behind clean room, exposed pipes, storage lockers. Dim lighting, industrial sounds. The compass shows contamination vectors leaking from hidden compartments. Emergency access routes and utility tunnels for pursuit sequences.

**Narrative:** You confront the insider in the waste processing area. They claim the extra waste is due to production errors, but the compass reveals quantum signatures that tell a different story. The compass's haunted personality manifests as Gasket's fragmented memories of similar industrial espionage cases.

**Puzzle:** Component Matching & Relic Recovery
- **Objective:** Match recovered components to production schematics while collecting evidence relics
- **Mechanics:** Drag-and-drop identification, serial number verification, quantum signature scanning
- **Solution:** Components are from restricted prototype line, hidden in waste with deliberate contamination markers
- **Clue:** Unique engraving marks, quantum signatures match production anomalies

**Environmental Interaction:** Facility Chase - Treasure Hunting Pursuit
- **Choice:** Careful inspection vs. direct accusation leading to pursuit
- **Consequence:** Careful approach finds quantum signature evidence; direct accusation causes evidence destruction attempt and ventilation shaft chase
- **Cinematic Element:** High-stakes pursuit through industrial facility with climbing and puzzle-solving

**Dialogue:**

**Insider:** (wiping sweat from brow, voice cracking) "It's just scrap! Quality control rejects happen all the time. You can't prove anything!"

**Helix:** "Oh sweetie, please. I've seen more convincing liars at a corporate sensitivity training seminar. Those 'rejects' have quantum signatures that match the prototype line. And that sweat? Not from the clean room environment."

**Optimus:** "Your access logs show 47 after-hours entries. Probability of legitimate maintenance: 3.2%. The contamination patterns suggest deliberate transport, not accidental rejects."

**ZTech:** "These components? They're from the restricted prototype batch! I can tell by the engraving. Oh, and check this particle analyzer - it also predicts stock market trends and suggests lunch options!"

**Quality Tech:** (adjusting glasses, shocked) "Those components shouldn't be in waste. They're from the new prototype batch. Someone deliberately routed them here!"

**Insider:** (panicking) "It wasn't my idea! They said it was just 'recycling'! The money was too good!"

**Facility Manager:** (defensive) "This is outrageous! My facility has the best contamination protocols in the industry!"

**Helix:** "Best protocols, maybe. Best security? That's debatable. Now, about those quantum signatures..."

**Optimus:** "Your access logs show 47 after-hours entries. Probability of legitimate maintenance: 3.2%. The contamination patterns suggest deliberate transport, not accidental rejects."

**ZTech:** "These components? They're from the restricted prototype batch! I can tell by the engraving. Oh, and check this particle analyzer - it also predicts stock market trends and suggests lunch options!"

## Scene 3: Resolution (1 minute)

**Background:** Facility security office with recovered components, contamination analysis displays, and evidence storage.

**Narrative:** The insider is exposed and the espionage pipeline halted. The team implements new security protocols, but the compass reveals a deeper quantum anomaly.

**Case Closure (95%):** Insider exposed, espionage pipeline halted, micro-components secured. The facility implements new quantum monitoring protocols.

**Shadow Unease (5%):** Components were auto-routed to a "custody destination nobody requested" - a secure facility that doesn't exist in any database. The compass readings suggest deliberate quantum manipulation.

**Team Debrief:**

**Helix:** "Well handled, Player. Nothing like a good old-fashioned insider threat to keep things interesting. Though I could do without the clean suits."

**Optimus:** "Fascinating contamination patterns. Almost as complex as the corporate excuses we just heard."

**ZTech:** "My contamination detector worked perfectly! Except for the Shakespeare drone. And the stock tips. But the evidence? Spot on!"

**Gasket:** (compass echo) "Quantum signatures... they linger. Like ghosts in the machine. Some destinations... they call to you."

**Epilogue Hook:** The "custody destination" appears in old facility blueprints from 50 years ago, but was digitally erased. The pattern suggests a long-term industrial espionage network.
