### NPCs
- **Subcontractor Leader:** Mid-40s, professional, betrayed expression, realizes too late they were being used
- **Cell Members:** Various ages, tactical gear, nervous, caught between loyalty and fear
- **Warehouse Security:** Late 30s, incompetent, uniform, more interested in his phone than security
- **Custody Officer:** Early 50s, procedural, clipboard, obsessed with paperwork and forms

## Scene 1: Warehouse Raid (2 minutes)

**Background:** Industrial warehouse district, corrugated metal walls, stacked crates, dim fluorescent lighting. Shielded sensor module creating interference patterns. Rooftop access points and ventilation systems for stealth approaches.

**Narrative:** The team raids a warehouse where a subcontractor cell is hiding a stolen prototype sensor module. The Crimson Compass shows interference patterns from the shielded module, its haunted nature manifesting as Gasket's tactical memories from similar operations.

**Compass Mini-Puzzle:** Signal Interference Mapping - Anomaly Detection
- **Objective:** Use compass to detect sensor module location through interference pattern analysis
- **Mechanics:** Scan warehouse for quantum signal disruptions, identify anomaly clusters, track module shielding signatures
- **Solution:** Interference patterns reveal module location and guard patrol routes, uncovering deprecated custody route codes
- **Reward:** Early detection of extraction routes and access to hidden storage areas

**Treasure Hunting Element:** Warehouse Exploration - Relic Collection
- **Choice:** Direct raid vs. stealth infiltration through ventilation systems
- **Consequence:** Ventilation approach yields prototype relics but risks detection; direct raid triggers security response

**Dialogue:**

**Helix:** "Remember the plan, people. In and out like a bad blind date. ZTech, keep those drones quiet. Optimus, try not to confuse the quantum communicator with a telephone again."

**Optimus:** "Target acquired. Interference patterns suggest quantum shielding. Probability of armed resistance: 67%. And Helix - this 'communicator' has more buttons than my old rotary phone!"

**ZTech:** "Their security is full of holes! Check this signal jammer I built - it also brews coffee and predicts when it'll rain. Maximum absurdity, maximum function!"

**Gasket:** (sudden holographic appearance, urgent) "Not like this. The patterns... they're wrong. The compass sees what they don't want you to see."

**Player Choice Options:**

1. **X (Helix):** "Coordinate team positions systematically. Safety first."
   - **Consequence:** Methodical approach reveals subcontractor communications and extraction plans.
   - **Dialogue:** Helix: "Good instincts. People talk when they're nervous. And right now, someone's sweating more than they should."

2. **Y (Optimus):** "Run tactical analysis on the interference patterns."
   - **Consequence:** Statistical analysis reveals the sensor module's exact location and shielding weaknesses.
   - **Dialogue:** Optimus: "The interference patterns... they're not random. Probability of deliberate shielding: 94.7%."

3. **Z (ZTech):** "Deploy surveillance drone swarm. Tech to the rescue!"
   - **Consequence:** Drones map the warehouse but also accidentally activate the fire suppression system.
   - **Dialogue:** ZTech: "My drones work perfectly! Except for the one that started reciting poetry. But hey, we got the intel!"

4. **G (Gasket):** "Trust the compass - the anomaly patterns show the real threat."
   - **Consequence:** Compass reveals the subcontractor cell is being manipulated by a larger organization.
   - **Dialogue:** Gasket: (haunted voice) "The double stamp... it's not theirs. Someone else is pulling the strings. The compass remembers these patterns."

## Scene 2: Confrontation & Pursuit (2 minutes)

**Background:** Warehouse interior with stacked crates, dim lighting, subcontractor cell in tactical positions. Hidden compartments and emergency exits for action sequences.

**Narrative:** The confrontation reveals the subcontractor leader was being used as a decoy. The Crimson Compass detects deprecated custody route codes that suggest a larger conspiracy, with Gasket providing fragmented tactical guidance.

**Puzzle:** Module Recovery & Pattern Analysis
- **Objective:** Secure sensor module while analyzing custody route anomalies
- **Mechanics:** Track module through interference patterns, decode deprecated route codes, identify manipulation signatures
- **Solution:** Module recovered, route codes reveal "ROUTE-NULL" pattern used in multiple thefts
- **Clue:** Quantum signatures on module match previous cases, anomaly patterns show coordinated network

**Environmental Interaction:** Warehouse Chase - Treasure Hunting Pursuit
- **Choice:** Pursue leader directly vs. secure module first
- **Consequence:** Direct pursuit captures leader but allows accomplice escape; securing module first reveals additional evidence relics
- **Cinematic Element:** Dynamic pursuit through warehouse with climbing and environmental puzzles

**Dialogue:**

**Subcontractor Leader:** (betrayed, backing away) "You don't understand! They promised us protection! This was supposed to be a simple job!"

**Helix:** "Oh sweetie, please. 'Simple job'? Stealing prototype sensors? That's not simple, that's career suicide. Now, about those route codes..."

**Optimus:** "Route analysis shows deprecated 'ROUTE-NULL' patterns. Probability of coincidence: 0.01%. These codes have been used before."

**ZTech:** "Their encryption is child's play! I could crack it with this pen! It also translates 47 languages and predicts the weather!"

**Gasket:** (appearing urgently, fragmented) "The double stamp... it's a signal. Someone's testing you. The compass sees the pattern. Don't let them use you too."

**Subcontractor Leader:** (panicking) "The codes... they were in the system! We didn't create them! Someone else did!"

**Helix:** "And that's exactly what we're going to find out. Now, about those accomplices..."

## Scene 3: Resolution (1 minute)

**Background:** Warehouse security area with recovered module, evidence displays, and team debrief setup.

**Narrative:** The sensor module is secured and the cell arrested, but the compass reveals disturbing pattern anomalies.

**Case Closure (95%):** Sensor recovered, subcontractor cell arrested, immediate theft operation dismantled.

**Shadow Unease (5%):** Deprecated custody route code ("ROUTE-NULL" style) appears in multiple unrelated cases. The compass detects pattern anomalies suggesting a coordinated theft network.

**Team Debrief:**

**Helix:** "Well handled, Player. Though I could do without the holographic interruptions from our ghostly friend."

**Optimus:** "Fascinating pattern anomalies. The 'ROUTE-NULL' codes suggest deliberate manipulation. Most... intriguing."

**ZTech:** "My signal tracker worked perfectly! Except for the poetry drone. And the fire sprinklers. But the module? Secured!"

**Gasket:** (fading, haunted) "The double stamp... it's just the beginning. The patterns... they go deeper than you know."

**Epilogue Hook:** The "ROUTE-NULL" codes trace back to a deprecated system that was officially retired years ago. The pattern suggests someone with high-level access is reactivating old infrastructure.
