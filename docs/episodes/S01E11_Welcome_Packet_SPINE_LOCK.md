### NPCs
- **HR Manager:** Mid-40s, professional attire, clipboard, obsessed with onboarding and employee experience
- **IT Support Specialist:** Late 20s, casual clothes, laptop, handles new employee setups
- **New Employee:** Early 30s, nervous, welcome packet in hand, excited but overwhelmed
- **Corporate Trainer:** Mid-30s, enthusiastic, presentation materials, conducts orientation sessions

## Scene 1: Onboarding Investigation (2 minutes)

**Background:** Corporate orientation room with welcome packets, computers, and presentation screens. Malware signatures creating interference patterns. Break rooms and service corridors for stealth approaches.

**Narrative:** The team investigates a welcome packet containing embedded malware targeting new employees. The Crimson Compass detects manipulation signatures, with Gasket's memories surfacing about similar social engineering attacks.

**Compass Mini-Puzzle:** Malware Signature Analysis - Anomaly Detection
- **Objective:** Use compass to detect malware patterns in welcome packets
- **Mechanics:** Scan packets for malware signatures, identify manipulation patterns, trace infection vectors
- **Solution:** Malware signatures reveal infection location and social engineering routes
- **Reward:** Access to hidden malware code and manipulation evidence

**Treasure Hunting Element:** Corporate Exploration - Relic Collection
- **Choice:** Direct orientation room access vs. break room infiltration
- **Consequence:** Orientation access yields packet relics but risks triggering alerts; break room reveals malware distribution evidence

**Dialogue:**

**Helix:** "Alright team, welcome aboard and remember: this is corporate onboarding, not a malware convention. ZTech, no reprogramming the welcome kiosks. Optimus, try not to confuse the malware scanner with a virus checker."

**Optimus:** "Malware signatures detected. Probability of targeted infection: 87.6%. This social engineering... it's not amateur. Someone's been very manipulative."

**ZTech:** "Their security is full of holes! Check this malware scanner I built - it also brews coffee and predicts when it'll rain! Maximum absurdity, maximum function!"

**Gasket:** (sudden holographic appearance, urgent) "Not manipulative. Dangerous. The compass sees the patterns... digital ghosts in the packets."

**Player Choice Options:**

1. **X (Helix):** "Coordinate with HR for proper onboarding protocols."
   - **Consequence:** Official access reveals packet distribution logs and infection timeline.
   - **Dialogue:** Helix: "Good call. HR loves procedures. And right now, someone's procedures are about to get very interesting."

2. **Y (Optimus):** "Analyze the malware patterns statistically."
   - **Consequence:** Statistical analysis reveals the malware's structure and social engineering tactics.
   - **Dialogue:** Optimus: "The malware patterns... they're not random. Probability of insider involvement: 79.4%."

3. **Z (ZTech):** "Deploy packet analysis drones. Tech to the rescue!"
   - **Consequence:** Drones scan the packets but also accidentally trigger a system update.
   - **Dialogue:** ZTech: "My drones work perfectly! Except for the one that started analyzing employee data. But hey, we got the malware!"

4. **G (Gasket):** "Trust the compass - the malware anomalies show the real infection."
   - **Consequence:** Compass reveals the malware is part of a larger corporate espionage campaign.
   - **Dialogue:** Gasket: (haunted voice) "The welcome packet... it's not welcoming. The compass remembers these digital scars."

## Scene 2: Malware Neutralization & Confrontation (2 minutes)

**Background:** IT support area with computers, welcome packets, and malware analysis stations. Hidden compartments and emergency exits for action sequences.

**Narrative:** The confrontation reveals the IT support specialist was distributing the infected packets. The Crimson Compass detects social engineering patterns that suggest a coordinated infection campaign.

**Puzzle:** Packet Quarantine & Pattern Analysis
- **Objective:** Quarantine malware while analyzing social engineering patterns
- **Mechanics:** Isolate infected packets, decode manipulation signatures, identify infection networks
- **Solution:** Malware quarantined, patterns reveal coordinated espionage operation
- **Clue:** Social engineering signatures match corporate intelligence patterns, patterns show systematic employee targeting

**Environmental Interaction:** Corporate Chase - Treasure Hunting Pursuit
- **Choice:** Pursue specialist directly vs. secure packets first
- **Consequence:** Direct pursuit captures specialist but allows packet destruction; securing packets first reveals additional malware evidence
- **Cinematic Element:** Dynamic pursuit through orientation areas and support offices with climbing and environmental puzzles

**Dialogue:**

**IT Support Specialist:** (defensive, backing against computer rack) "I was just following protocol! The welcome packets are standard issue! The malware wasn't my idea!"

**Helix:** "Oh sweetie, 'standard' welcome packets with embedded malware? That's like saying a poisoned apple is just a healthy snack. Now, about those social engineering patterns..."

**Optimus:** "Pattern analysis shows infection signatures. Probability of coordinated espionage: 84.7%. Most... concerning."

**ZTech:** "Their malware is child's play! I could quarantine it with this USB drive! It also transfers files and predicts the weather!"

**Gasket:** (appearing urgently, fragmented) "The patterns... they're not just malware. Someone's testing social limits. The compass sees the infection."

**IT Support Specialist:** (breaking down) "The patterns... they were in the system! We didn't create them! Someone else did!"

**Helix:** "And that's exactly what we're going to find out. Now, about those espionage contacts..."

## Scene 3: Resolution (1 minute)

**Background:** Corporate security office with quarantined packets, evidence displays, and team debrief setup.

**Narrative:** The malware is quarantined and the infection vector neutralized, but the compass reveals disturbing social engineering patterns.

**Case Closure (95%):** Malware quarantined, infection vector neutralized, immediate espionage operation stopped.

**Shadow Unease (5%):** Social engineering patterns appear in multiple onboarding processes. The compass detects manipulation signatures suggesting a coordinated corporate infection network.

**Team Debrief:**

**Helix:** "Well handled, Player. Though I could do without the holographic warnings from our spectral companion."

**Optimus:** "Disturbing social patterns. The engineering anomalies suggest sophisticated infection. Most... troubling."

**ZTech:** "My malware scanner worked perfectly! Except for the coffee brewing. And the weather predictions. But the packets? Quarantined!"

**Gasket:** (fading, haunted) "The patterns... they're just the beginning. The social breaches... they go deeper than you know."

**Epilogue Hook:** The social engineering patterns trace back to a competitor using advanced malware techniques. The pattern suggests someone is building a comprehensive corporate infection network through employee onboarding.
