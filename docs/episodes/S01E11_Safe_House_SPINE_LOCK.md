**Background:** Hidden safe house with evidence storage, computer systems, and cleanup equipment. Hidden exit protocol interference creating navigation anomalies. Service entrances and hidden compartments for stealth approaches.

**Narrative:** The team defends against a cleanup crew attempting to erase investigation evidence. The Crimson Compass detects hidden exit protocols in safe house systems, verifying evidence integrity.

**Compass Mini-Puzzle:** Exit Protocol Detection - Anomaly Detection
- **Objective:** Use compass to detect hidden exit protocols and evidence tampering
- **Mechanics:** Scan safe house systems for protocol anomalies, identify cleanup patterns, verify evidence integrity
- **Solution:** Protocol detection reveals cleanup routes and evidence preservation methods
- **Reward:** Access to hidden evidence caches and exit protocol evidence

**Treasure Hunting Element:** Safe House Defense - Relic Preservation
- **Choice:** Direct cleanup confrontation vs. evidence integrity verification
- **Consequence:** Direct confrontation yields cleanup relics but risks evidence damage; verification reveals tampering evidence

**Dialogue:**

**Helix:** "Alright team, cleanup incoming and remember: this is evidence preservation, not a demolition derby. ZTech, no reprogramming the security systems. Optimus, try not to confuse the evidence scanner with a photocopier."

**Optimus:** "Exit protocols detected. Probability of evidence tampering: 92.1%. This cleanup crew... they're too thorough. Someone's been very systematic."

**ZTech:** "Their protocols are laughable! Check this evidence scanner I built - it also brews coffee and predicts when it'll rain! Maximum absurdity, maximum function!"

**Gasket:** (sudden holographic appearance, urgent) "Not systematic. Dangerous. The compass sees the patterns... cleanup ghosts in the systems."

**Player Choice Options:**

1. **X (Helix):** "Coordinate evidence preservation protocols and team safety."
   - **Consequence:** Systematic preservation reveals cleanup crew communications and exit strategies.
   - **Dialogue:** Helix: "Good instincts. Evidence talks when it's preserved. And right now, someone's cleanup plan is falling apart."

2. **Y (Optimus):** "Analyze the exit protocol patterns statistically."
   - **Consequence:** Statistical analysis reveals the cleanup methodology and deeper cover-up implications.
   - **Dialogue:** Optimus: "The protocol patterns... they're not random. Probability of deeper conspiracy: 88.9%."

3. **Z (ZTech):** "Deploy evidence protection drones. Tech to the rescue!"
   - **Consequence:** Drones secure the safe house but also accidentally trigger emergency protocols.
   - **Dialogue:** ZTech: "My drones work perfectly! Except for the one that started analyzing air quality. But hey, we got the evidence!"

4. **G (Gasket):** "Trust the compass - the protocol anomalies show the real cover-up."
   - **Consequence:** Compass reveals the cleanup is part of a larger evidence destruction network.
   - **Dialogue:** Gasket: (haunted voice) "The safe house... it's not safe. The compass remembers these evidence scars."

## Scene 2: Cleanup Neutralization & Confrontation (2 minutes)

- **Solution:** Cleanup neutralized, protocols reveal coordinated evidence destruction operation
- **Clue:** Exit protocol patterns match systematic cover-up operations across investigations

**Environmental Interaction:** Safe House Chase - Treasure Hunting Pursuit
- **Choice:** Pursue cleanup crew directly vs. secure evidence first
- **Consequence:** Direct pursuit captures crew but allows evidence destruction; securing evidence first reveals additional protocol evidence
- **Cinematic Element:** Dynamic pursuit through safe house with climbing and environmental puzzles

**Dialogue:**

**Cleanup Specialist:** (methodical, backing away) "This is just procedure! The evidence... it needs to be sanitized! You can't stop the protocol!"

**Helix:** "Oh sweetie, 'sanitized' evidence destruction? That's like saying a shredder is just a fancy filing cabinet. Now, about those hidden exit protocols..."

**Optimus:** "Protocol analysis shows cover-up patterns. Probability of coordinated operation: 94.6%. Most... methodical."

**ZTech:** "Their protocols are child's play! I could neutralize them with this remote! It also controls TVs and predicts the weather!"

**Gasket:** (appearing urgently, fragmented) "The protocols... they're not just exits. Someone's testing cover-up limits. The compass sees the destruction."

**Cleanup Specialist:** (breaking composure) "The protocols... they were hidden! We didn't create them! Someone else did!"

**Helix:** "And that's exactly what we're going to find out. Now, about those cover-up contacts..."

## Scene 3: Resolution (1 minute)

**Background:** Safe house security area with preserved evidence, protocol displays, and team debrief setup.

**Narrative:** The cleanup crew is neutralized and evidence preserved, but the compass reveals disturbing exit protocols.

**Case Closure (95%):** Cleanup neutralized, evidence preserved, immediate cover-up operation stopped.

**Shadow Unease (5%):** Safe house contains hidden exit protocol suggesting deeper cover-up network.

**Team Debrief:**

**Helix:** "Well handled, Player. Though I could do without the holographic warnings from our phantom friend."

**Optimus:** "Disturbing exit protocols. The hidden systems suggest sophisticated cover-up. Most... troubling."

**ZTech:** "My evidence scanner worked perfectly! Except for the coffee brewing. And the weather predictions. But the evidence? Preserved!"

**Gasket:** (fading, haunted) "The protocols... they're just the beginning. The cover-up operations... they go deeper than you know."

**Epilogue Hook:** The hidden exit protocols appear in security footage from multiple safe houses, suggesting a systematic evidence destruction network operating across investigations.
