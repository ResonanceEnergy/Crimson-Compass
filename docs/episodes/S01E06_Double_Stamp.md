# S01E06: Double Stamp

## Episode Overview
**Title:** Double Stamp
**Case:** Subcontractor cell steals prototype sensor module
**Case Token:** Sensor recovered; cell arrested
**Shadow Token:** Deprecated custody route code ("ROUTE-NULL" style) (compass detects pattern anomalies)
**Theme:** Twist introduction, Gasket's return, pattern recognition, and Crimson Compass anomaly detection

## Character Ensemble (Futurama Uncharted Vibes)

### The Closer (Player) - "Gasket's Replacement"
First major encounter with the larger conspiracy patterns. The compass becomes more responsive, almost like it's trying to communicate something important.

### Optimus (Agent Y) - "The Bumbling Boomer Executive"
Analyzes theft patterns with his analytical mind, but gets confused by modern "tactical" terminology. Keeps calling drones "those flying robots."

### Helix (Agent X) - "Big Sister Administrative Glue"
Coordinates the multi-agency response while keeping the team from imploding. Her administrative skills cut through jurisdictional red tape.

### ZTech (Agent Z) - "Nerd Soldier Tech Genius"
Tracks the sensor module with absurd gadgets - a "quantum sniffer" that also predicts weather and suggests pizza toppings.

### Gasket (Agent G) - "Broken Prodigy"
**Returns with Fragment #1:** Makes his first major appearance since the incident, providing cryptic warnings about the larger pattern. His presence causes the compass to behave erratically.

### NPCs
- **Subcontractor Leader:** Mid-40s, professional, betrayed expression, realizes too late they were being used
- **Cell Members:** Various ages, tactical gear, nervous, caught between loyalty and fear
- **Warehouse Security:** Late 30s, incompetent, uniform, more interested in his phone than security
- **Custody Officer:** Early 50s, procedural, clipboard, obsessed with paperwork and forms

## Scene 1: Warehouse Raid

**Background:** Industrial warehouse district, corrugated metal walls, stacked crates, dim fluorescent lighting. The Crimson Compass shows interference patterns from the shielded sensor module.

**Narrative:** You've tracked the subcontractor cell to an industrial warehouse. Security is minimal, but the sensor module is highly valuable. The compass detects unusual signal patterns that don't match standard shielding.

**Compass Mini-Puzzle:** Signal Anomaly Detection
- **Objective:** Use compass to identify the module's location through interference patterns
- **Mechanics:** Scan for quantum signal distortions, triangulate source
- **Solution:** Module hidden in a container with temporal shielding (explains the "double stamp" theme)
- **Reward:** Precise location without triggering alarms

**Puzzle:** Sensor Signal Tracking
- **Objective:** Locate module using signal triangulation
- **Mechanics:** Multi-point signal strength analysis
- **Solution:** Module hidden in shielded container
- **Clue:** Interference patterns indicate active shielding

**Dialogue:**

**Helix:** "Everyone in position? This cell is professional - don't underestimate them. And Closer, keep that compass handy. It's been acting up lately."

**ZTech:** "Their security system? Laughable. I could bypass it with my eyes closed. Or this quantum sniffer - it also predicts weather and suggests pizza toppings!"

**Subcontractor Leader:** (betrayed, shaking his head) "You don't understand what's at stake here. They promised us protection. Said this was just 'acquisition.'"

**Optimus:** "Movement patterns suggest tactical training. Probability of armed resistance: 34%. The data doesn't lie."

**Player Choice Options:**

1. **X (Helix):** "Coordinate with local security for backup. Safety first."
   - **Consequence:** Backup arrives just in time for the confrontation, but alerts the cell.
   - **Dialogue:** Helix: "Backup's here. Let's do this by the book... mostly."

2. **Y (Optimus):** "Run pattern analysis on their movements. Predict their response."
   - **Consequence:** Analysis reveals the cell's escape route, allowing interception.
   - **Dialogue:** Optimus: "Their patterns are predictable. 67% chance they'll use the loading dock."

3. **Z (ZTech):** "Deploy sensor tracking drones. Tech to the rescue!"
   - **Consequence:** Drones locate the module but also accidentally activate the warehouse sprinkler system.
   - **Dialogue:** ZTech: "Drones found it! Though they also turned on the sprinklers. For 'cover,' I guess?"

4. **G (Compass):** "Trust the compass interference patterns."
   - **Consequence:** Compass leads to discovering the temporal shielding technology.
   - **Dialogue:** Gasket: (sudden appearance, intense) "Not like this. Never like this. The patterns... they're repeating."

## Scene 2: Custody Anomaly

**Background:** Temporary holding facility, processing desks, evidence lockers. Official but chaotic atmosphere. The compass vibrates erratically as Gasket approaches.

**Narrative:** The cell is in custody, but paperwork shows double stamps. Gasket appears suddenly, muttering about timing. The compass displays fragment overlays on the forms.

**Puzzle:** Custody Form Analysis
- **Objective:** Identify double-stamp anomaly
- **Mechanics:** Form comparison, timestamp verification
- **Solution:** Two identical stamps with microsecond difference
- **Clue:** Ink analysis shows chemical composition variation

**Environmental Interaction:** Custody Processing
- **Choice:** Standard processing vs. anomaly investigation
- **Consequence:** Anomaly investigation reveals the temporal manipulation but delays processing

**Dialogue:**

**Custody Officer:** (bureaucratic, checking clipboard) "Everything seems in order. Standard procedure. Double stamps? That's just our new system. Very efficient."

**Optimus:** "Double stamp detected. Probability of clerical error: 0.03%. The microsecond difference suggests deliberate manipulation."

**Gasket:** (appearing suddenly, intense eyes, voice haunted) "...we were already late—" (Fragment #1 appears as compass overlay)

**Helix:** "Gasket? You're back. What the hell happened to you? And what does 'we were already late' mean?"

**ZTech:** "Whoa, the compass is going crazy! And check this stamp analyzer - it also detects lies and brews decaf!"

**Subcontractor Leader:** (defeated, slumped) "You think this is about money? They have technology... things that bend time itself."

**Custody Officer:** (nervous now) "This isn't standard procedure. These forms... they weren't like this when I stamped them."

**Gasket:** (fading, voice echoing) "The patterns repeat. The compass sees them. But some doors... they open both ways."

## Puzzles & Mechanics

### Warehouse Navigation
- **Type:** Stealth Infiltration
- **Description:** Avoid detection while locating module
- **Solution:** Service corridors bypass main security
- **Reward:** Clean entry, evidence preservation

### Double Stamp Investigation
- **Type:** Forensic Analysis
- **Description:** Examine custody form anomalies
- **Solution:** Reveals systematic manipulation
- **Reward:** Shadow Token, Gasket Fragment

## Episode Resolution

**Case Closure (95%):** Sensor module recovered, subcontractor cell arrested, immediate threat neutralized. The double stamp anomaly is documented.

**Shadow Unease (5%):** Deprecated custody route code shows "ROUTE-NULL" entries that don't exist in the system. The compass readings suggest temporal manipulation of the paperwork itself.

**Team Debrief:**

**Helix:** "Gasket's back... sort of. And what the hell was that fragment about? 'We were already late?'"

**Optimus:** "Fascinating temporal anomalies. The double stamps suggest quantum interference in the documentation process."

**ZTech:** "My stamp analyzer worked perfectly! Except for the lie detection. And the coffee brewing. But the evidence? Spot on!"

**Gasket:** (compass fragment echo) "The patterns... they repeat. The compass remembers what time forgets."

**Epilogue Hook:** The "ROUTE-NULL" code appears in other custody systems across the city. The pattern suggests a network manipulating evidence at the quantum level.
