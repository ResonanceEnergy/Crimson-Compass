**Title:** Double Stamp  
**Case:** Subcontractor cell steals prototype sensor module  
**Case Token:** Sensor recovered; cell arrested  
**Shadow Token:** Deprecated custody route code ("ROUTE-NULL" style)  
**Theme:** Twist introduction, Gasket's return, pattern recognition  

## Character Descriptions

### Player (The Closer)
- **Appearance:** Intense focus, processing new information
- **Background:** First encounter with larger patterns
- **Personality:** Intrigued by anomalies, questioning assumptions

### Advisors
- **Helix:** Coordinating multi-agency response
- **Optimus:** Pattern analysis of theft methods
- **ZTech:** Technical tracking of sensor module
- **Gasket:** Returns with Fragment #1

### NPCs
- **Subcontractor Leader:** Mid-40s, professional, betrayed expression
- **Cell Members:** Various ages, tactical gear, nervous
- **Warehouse Security:** Late 30s, incompetent, uniform

## Scene 1: Warehouse Raid

**Background:** Industrial warehouse district, corrugated metal walls, stacked crates, dim fluorescent lighting.

**Narrative:** You've tracked the subcontractor cell to an industrial warehouse. Security is minimal, but the sensor module is highly valuable.

**Puzzle:** Sensor Signal Tracking  
- **Objective:** Locate module using signal triangulation  
- **Mechanics:** Multi-point signal strength analysis  
- **Solution:** Module hidden in shielded container  
- **Clue:** Interference patterns indicate active shielding

**Dialogue:**

**Helix:** "Everyone in position? This cell is professional - don't underestimate them."

**ZTech:** "Their security system? Laughable. I could bypass it with my eyes closed."

**Subcontractor Leader:** "You don't understand what's at stake here."

## Scene 2: Custody Anomaly

**Background:** Temporary holding facility, processing desks, evidence lockers. Official but chaotic atmosphere.

**Narrative:** The cell is in custody, but paperwork shows double stamps. Gasket appears, muttering about timing.

**Puzzle:** Custody Form Analysis  
- **Objective:** Identify double-stamp anomaly  
- **Mechanics:** Form comparison, timestamp verification  
- **Solution:** Two identical stamps with microsecond difference  
- **Clue:** Ink analysis shows chemical composition variation

**Dialogue:**

**Custody Officer:** "Everything seems in order. Standard procedure."

**Optimus:** "Double stamp detected. Probability of clerical error: 0.03%."

**Gasket:** "...we were already late—" (Fragment #1)

## Puzzles & Mechanics
