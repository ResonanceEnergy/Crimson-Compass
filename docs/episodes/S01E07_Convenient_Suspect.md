## Scene 1: Suspect Interrogation

**Background:** Interrogation room, two-way mirror, recording equipment. Stark lighting, uncomfortable chairs. The Crimson Compass shows deception vectors swirling around the suspect like a perfectly constructed web.

**Narrative:** The suspect in custody appears to be the perfect culprit - all evidence points to them, but the compass detects the artificial perfection of the frame job.

**Compass Mini-Puzzle:** Deception Pattern Analysis
- **Objective:** Use compass to identify the artificial nature of the evidence
- **Mechanics:** Scan for deception vector patterns, identify manufactured consistency
- **Solution:** Evidence shows quantum-level fabrication signatures
- **Reward:** Early detection that this is a false flag operation

**Puzzle:** Alibi Verification
- **Objective:** Cross-reference suspect's timeline with evidence
- **Mechanics:** Timeline reconstruction, witness correlation
- **Solution:** Suspect's alibi has unexplained gaps
- **Clue:** Digital footprints show fabricated activity

**Dialogue:**

**Decoy Suspect:** (genuinely confused, shaking head) "I don't understand. I was just doing my job. I access systems all the time for maintenance!"

**Helix:** "And your job included accessing restricted systems at 2:47 AM? How convenient that all the evidence points right to you. Almost too convenient."

**Optimus:** "Evidence chain is too perfect. Statistical anomaly detected. Probability of natural occurrence: 0.07%. The universe doesn't create frames this clean."

**ZTech:** "Their digital trail? It's like someone drew it with a ruler. And check this lie detector headset - it also plays music and takes notes!"

**Player Choice Options:**

1. **X (Helix):** "Interview the suspect gently. Build trust to uncover inconsistencies."
   - **Consequence:** Suspect reveals genuine confusion, confirming the frame job.
   - **Dialogue:** Helix: "Sweetie, I can see you're as confused as a chameleon in a bag of skittles. Let's figure this out together."

2. **Y (Optimus):** "Run evidence correlation analysis. Data reveals the frame."
   - **Consequence:** Statistical analysis proves the evidence was planted simultaneously.
   - **Dialogue:** Optimus: "The timestamps... they align too perfectly. Like someone used a quantum synchronizer."

3. **Z (ZTech):** "Deploy digital forensics drone swarm. Tech the evidence!"
   - **Consequence:** Drones uncover fabricated digital trails but accidentally delete some evidence.
   - **Dialogue:** ZTech: "My drones found the ghost account! Though they also deleted my browser history. Whoops!"

4. **G (Compass):** "Let the compass reveal the deception patterns."
   - **Consequence:** Compass shows the quantum fabrication signatures in the evidence.
   - **Dialogue:** Gasket: (compass fragment) "Frames within frames... like Russian nesting dolls of deception. But the compass sees through them all."

## Scene 2: Frame Job Revelation

**Background:** Evidence locker, organized shelves, examination tables. Forensic equipment, analysis screens. The compass shows quantum fabrication signatures on the planted evidence.

**Narrative:** You've uncovered the framing operation. The decoy was planted to cover the real sabotage attempt. The compass reveals the premeditated nature of the deception.

**Puzzle:** Evidence Chain Deconstruction
- **Objective:** Identify planted vs genuine evidence
- **Mechanics:** Chain of custody verification, authenticity testing
- **Solution:** Multiple pieces trace to same source
- **Clue:** Chemical residue on planted evidence

**Environmental Interaction:** Evidence Examination
- **Choice:** Thorough analysis vs. quick verification
- **Consequence:** Thorough analysis reveals quantum fabrication; quick verification misses key details

**Dialogue:**

**Forensic Tech:** (excited, adjusting glasses) "These fingerprints? Too clean. Like they were pressed on purpose. And this chemical residue? It's from a quantum fabricator!"

**ZTech:** "Digital trail leads to a ghost account. Professional job. My forensics drone found the quantum signature - it's like someone printed the evidence out of nothing!"

**Real Culprit:** (unassuming, almost bored) "You think you understand, but you're just seeing the surface. The frame was perfect. Until it wasn't."

**Helix:** "Oh honey, perfect? Please. Your 'perfect' frame had more holes than a conspiracy theorist's notebook. The compass saw right through your quantum printing press."

**Optimus:** "Evidence convergence analysis complete. All fabricated items share identical quantum signatures. Probability of coincidence: effectively zero."

**Decoy Suspect:** (relieved, slumping in chair) "Thank god. I knew I didn't do this. Someone set me up!"

**ZTech:** "And they used some fancy quantum tech to do it! My detector picked up temporal anomalies in the ink. Like the evidence was created... before it was planted?"

## Puzzles & Mechanics

### Timeline Reconstruction
- **Type:** Evidence Correlation
- **Description:** Build suspect's activity timeline
- **Solution:** Reveals staging inconsistencies
- **Reward:** Frame identification

### Digital Forensics
- **Type:** Trail Analysis
- **Description:** Trace fabricated digital evidence
- **Solution:** Ghost account leads to real perpetrator
- **Reward:** Culprit location

## Episode Resolution

**Case Closure (95%):** Sabotage prevented, decoy arrested (and cleared), real culprit identified. The false flag operation is exposed.

**Shadow Unease (5%):** Exit plan was staged before the crime, with evidence planted weeks in advance. The compass detects quantum temporal manipulation in the fabrication process.

**Team Debrief:**

**Helix:** "Well caught that frame job, Closer. Though I could do without the quantum printing press nonsense. Who has that kind of tech?"

**Optimus:** "Fascinating quantum fabrication signatures. The temporal manipulation suggests advanced technology beyond current capabilities."

**ZTech:** "My quantum detector worked perfectly! Except for the music playlist. And the note-taking. But the evidence? Spot on!"

**Gasket:** (compass fragment) "Frames within frames... the oldest trick. But quantum forgery? That's new. Dangerous."

**Epilogue Hook:** The quantum fabricator technology appears in other cases. The pattern suggests a black market for "perfect" false flag operations.
