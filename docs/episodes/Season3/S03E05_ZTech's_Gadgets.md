## Scene 1: Gadget Sabotage Investigation (2 minutes)

**Background:** Advanced gadget laboratory with anomaly generators, sabotage terminals, and historical data displays. Gadget distortions create technological visual effects.

**Narrative:** The team investigates sabotage using advanced gadget technology with compass anomalies. The Crimson Compass detects gadget patterns revealing connections to Gasket's traumatic past.

**Compass Mini-Puzzle:** Gadget Anomaly Mapping - Sabotage Detection
- **Objective:** Use compass to map gadget anomalies and detect sabotage patterns
- **Mechanics:** Trace gadget pathways, identify sabotage signatures, stabilize anomaly readings
- **Solution:** Anomaly mapping reveals sabotage methods and past trauma connections
- **Reward:** Access to enhanced gadget capabilities and historical intelligence

**Treasure Hunting Element:** Laboratory Exploration - Gadget Hunt
- **Choice:** Direct sabotage investigation vs. compass-guided anomaly exploration
- **Consequence:** Direct investigation yields gadget relics but risks missing anomaly evidence; anomaly exploration reveals past trauma hints

**Dialogue:**

**Helix:** "Gadget sabotage investigation and anomaly analysis. Remember: this is advanced gadget work, not a tech expo. ZTech, no experimental anomaly detectors that turn the lab into a disco. Optimus, gadget anomalies aren't just statistical visualizations."

**Optimus:** "Anomaly analysis initiated. Probability of historical interference: 79.4%. These sabotage patterns... they suggest past-level operations."

**ZTech:** "Their gadgets are laughable! Check this detector I built - it also predicts sabotages and brews coffee! Maximum absurdity, maximum gadget clarity!"

**Gasket:** (sudden holographic appearance, urgent) "Patterns... they're not just gadgets. Dangerous. The compass sees the sabotage... past traumas awakening."

**Player Choice Options:**

1. **X (Helix):** "Coordinate team gadget procedures and anomaly analysis."
   - **Consequence:** Systematic investigation reveals sabotage timeline and past connection patterns.
   - **Dialogue:** Helix: "Good coordination. Gadgets and past traumas need careful handling. And right now, someone's sabotages are about to get very analyzed."

2. **Y (Optimus):** "Analyze the gadget anomaly patterns statistically."
   - **Consequence:** Statistical analysis reveals the sabotage structure and past connection correlations.
   - **Dialogue:** Optimus: "The anomaly patterns... they're perfectly orchestrated. Probability of deliberate past connection: 88.9%."

3. **Z (ZTech):** "Deploy gadget anomaly drones. Tech to the rescue!"
   - **Consequence:** Drones map anomalies but also accidentally trigger sabotage field alerts.
   - **Dialogue:** ZTech: "My drones work perfectly! Except for the one that started detecting anomalies autonomously. But hey, we got the lab!"

4. **G (Gasket):** "Trust the compass - the gadget anomalies show the real past fractures."
   - **Consequence:** Compass reveals the anomalies expose connections to Gasket's traumatic past.
   - **Dialogue:** Gasket: (haunted voice) "The revelation... it's not just gadgets. The compass remembers the past scars."

## Scene 2: Sabotage Operation Confrontation & Past Analysis (2 minutes)

**Background:** Gadget chamber with anomaly generators, sabotage equipment, and historical displays. Hidden past pathways and emergency protocols for action sequences.

**Narrative:** The confrontation reveals the sabotage operation using gadget technology to manipulate historical records. The Crimson Compass detects anomaly patterns indicating deeper past trauma layers.

**Puzzle:** Gadget Security & Anomaly Analysis
- **Objective:** Secure sabotage operation while analyzing past trauma patterns
- **Mechanics:** Manipulate gadget fields, decode anomaly signatures, identify past connections
- **Solution:** Operation secured, anomaly patterns reveal past trauma network
- **Clue:** Anomaly patterns match signatures from historical sabotage operations

**Environmental Interaction:** Chamber Chase - Past Pursuit
- **Choice:** Pursue saboteur directly vs. secure past data first
- **Consequence:** Direct pursuit captures saboteur but allows field reactivation; securing data first reveals complete past intelligence
- **Cinematic Element:** Dynamic pursuit through past fields with climbing and environmental puzzles

**Dialogue:**

**Saboteur:** (defensive, backing against gadget console) "The gadget anomalies protect us! The past traumas... they're ours to manipulate!"

**Helix:** "Oh sweetie, 'protective' gadget anomalies? That's like saying a coffee maker is just a fancy water boiler. Now, about those past trauma connections..."

**Optimus:** "Anomaly analysis shows past interference. Probability of trauma connection: 93.5%. Most... concerning."

**ZTech:** "Their sabotage is child's play! I could secure it with this analyzer! It also plays music and predicts the weather!"

**Gasket:** (appearing urgently, fragmented) "The patterns... they're not just gadgets. Someone's manipulating past realities. The compass sees the traumas."

**Saboteur:** (breaking down) "The networks... they were everywhere! I didn't create them! Someone else did!"

**Helix:** "And that's exactly what we've analyzed. Now, about those past contacts..."

## Scene 3: Resolution (1 minute)

**Background:** Gadget laboratory security office with stabilized anomalies, sabotage displays, and team debrief setup.

**Narrative:** The sabotage operation is dismantled and gadget tech secured, but the compass reveals Gasket's past trauma connections.

**Case Closure (95%):** Sabotage operation dismantled; gadget tech secured, immediate threat neutralized.

**Shadow Unease (5%):** Gadget anomalies reveal Gasket's past trauma connections.

**Team Debrief:**

**Helix:** "Well handled, Player. Though I could do without the holographic warnings from our spectral companion."

**Optimus:** "Disturbing anomaly patterns. The past connections suggest trauma-level sabotage involvement. Most... concerning."

**ZTech:** "My gadget detector worked perfectly! Except for the coffee brewing. And the weather predictions. But the sabotages? Analyzed!"

**Gasket:** (fading, haunted) "The patterns... they're just the beginning. The past traumas... they go deeper than you know."

**Epilogue Hook:** The past trauma connections hint at deeper historical conspiracy networks, suggesting Season 3 will explore more personal histories.
