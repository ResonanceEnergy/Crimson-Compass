# Crimson Compass — Series Foundation + Season 3 Kit (Export)

**Purpose of this file:** A single, up-to-speed reference for Season 3, building on Seasons 1-2's foundation. This is designed to be dropped into a repo (e.g., `docs/`) and used as the canonical guide for writing Season 3 episodes.

## 0) Brand Spine (Inherited from Series)

> **You’re the sane detective brought in to close cases for an absurdly elite but dysfunctional covert agency that prevents global collapse through paperwork, gadgets, and luck—while a shadowy adversary is only ever inferred through the clues left behind, always slipping away.**

**Tone Formula:** Mission: Impossible stakes + James Bond global cool + Ocean’s team chemistry + Futurama-style institutional absurdity.

**Two Core Hooks (every episode must serve both):**
1) **Mission Hook:** close the case.
2) **Team Hook:** survive the team.

## Season 3 Overview: Recovery Paradoxes

**Season Theme:** Custody manipulation and recovery operation sabotage. The adversary exploits recovery protocols, turning rescue operations and asset reclamation into traps and false recoveries.

**Core Escalation:** From Season 2's supply chain weaponization, Season 3 reveals how recovery systems are compromised—assets "recovered" are actually enhanced traps, custody transfers create paradoxes, and rescue operations become hunting grounds.

**Shadow Hunt Progression:** Anomalies now show paradoxical recoveries (e.g., assets recovered but somehow still compromised). The adversary's manipulation of recovery protocols becomes systematic and predictive.

## S03_SEAMLINE (working title)

### Theme Lens (Case Hunt)
Recovery operation sabotage: compromised rescues, paradoxical custody transfers, "recovered" assets that are actually traps, institutional recovery system exploitation.

### Shadow Motifs (Season 3)
- **Motif A:** Recovery Resets (operations that appear successful but reset adversary position).
- **Motif B:** Arrest Timing Anomalies (custody transfers with unexplained delays or accelerations).
- **Motif C:** Resource Reallocations (assets route to unauthorized recovery destinations).
- **Motif D:** Recovery Decoys (false recoveries designed to mislead investigators).
- **Motif E:** Recovery Implants (compromised assets returned with hidden enhancements).
- **Motif F:** Sensory Implants (witnesses/testimonies altered through recovery interventions).

### Twists
- **Twist 1 (Ep 6–7):** Recontextualization — recovery operations across cases share a hidden reset protocol.
- **Twist 2 (Ep 12):** Hindsight Lock — all "successful" recoveries converge on a paradox network.

### Gasket Cadence
- Appears: Ep 4, Ep 8, Ep 12.
- Fragments: Ep 8 and Ep 12.

### Forbidden Lever
- One optional catastrophic **G** choice recommended in Ep 12.

## Episode Grid (Season 3)

### Act 1: Recovery Setup (Episodes 1-4)
**Ep 25: Recovery Reset** - Asset recovery operation goes perfectly but adversary escapes cleanly.
**Ep 26: Timing Paradox** - Arrest timing shows unexplained 11-minute skew during transfer.
**Ep 27: Resource Reallocation** - Recovered assets route to unauthorized destination.
**Ep 28: Decoy Recovery** - False recovery operation misleads investigation.

### Act 2: Recovery Escalation (Episodes 5-8)
**Ep 29: Implant Trap** - "Recovered" asset contains hidden adversary enhancement.
**Ep 30: Sensory Override** - Witness testimony altered through recovery intervention.
**Ep 31: Custody Cascade** - Multiple custody transfers create jurisdictional paradox.
**Ep 32: Reset Protocol** - Recovery operation triggers adversary position reset.

### Act 3: Recovery Convergence (Episodes 9-12)
**Ep 33: Paradox Network** - Recovery operations reveal interconnected reset system.
**Ep 34: Enhanced Assets** - All recovered items show adversary modifications.
**Ep 35: Timing Lock** - Arrest timing anomalies cluster around critical transfers.
**Ep 36: Recovery Paradox** - Final recovery operation exposes the paradox network.

## Writing Guidelines (Season 3)

### Tone Balance
- **Recovery Success/Failure Paradox:** Operations that succeed but fail
- **Custody Irony:** Secure transfers that create vulnerabilities
- **Asset Betrayal:** Recovered items that turn against the agency

### Pacing Rules
- **Setup (Ep 1-4):** Establish recovery operation normality
- **Escalation (Ep 5-8):** Reveal systematic compromises
- **Convergence (Ep 9-12):** Connect paradoxes into network

### Thematic Elements
- **Recovery as Trap:** What seems like success is actually compromise
- **Timing as Weapon:** Precise manipulation of custody windows
- **Assets as Vectors:** Recovered items as adversary extensions
- **Paradox as Truth:** Inconsistencies reveal the real operation
