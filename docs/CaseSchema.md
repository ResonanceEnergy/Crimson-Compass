# Case Schema (v0.3)

## Deduction Spine (Triad)
Every mission resolves a hidden triad:
- **WHO** (suspect)
- **HOW** (method/tool)
- **WHERE** (location/city)

## Key rules
- Hypothesis produces **one disproof** (never more).
- Accusation is a **commitment gate**.
- OPTIMUS offers **3 hints/mission** (each costs Time + Heat).
- ZTECH offers **5 gadgets**, player selects **3** for the mission.
