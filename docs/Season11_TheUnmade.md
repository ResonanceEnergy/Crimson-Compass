# Season 11: The Unmade - Advanced Mechanics Guide

## Overview
Season 11 represents the transcendence beyond nothingness, where existence is not merely dissolved but retroactively erased. In "The Unmade," investigators confront realities where events never occurred, concepts were never conceived, and existence itself is systematically unwritten from the fabric of being.

## Core Theme: Retroactive Oblivion
In Season 11, agents operate in domains where:
- **Retroactive Erasure**: Events are unwritten from history (starts at 0.0, approaches 1.0)
- **Causal Annihilation**: Cause-and-effect relationships are annihilated
- **Memory Nullification**: Memories are erased, including the memory of having memories
- **Existence Retrogression**: Being itself unravels backward through time
- **Temporal Unraveling**: Time undoes itself, unraveling from future to past
- **Conceptual Oblivion**: Ideas and concepts are erased from ever having existed

## Unmaking Events
Each Season 11 case includes 3 unmaking events that trigger based on retroactive erasure levels:

### Retroactive Erasure Events
- Trigger when history unraveling reaches critical levels
- Effect: history_dissolution
- Severity increases with unmaking progression

### Causal Annihilation Events
- Trigger when cause-and-effect relationships break down
- Effect: logic_breakdown
- Impacts deductive reasoning and strategic planning

### Conceptual Oblivion Events
- Trigger when ideas and concepts fade into non-existence
- Effect: idea_erasure
- Most severe, can lead to complete conceptual breakdown

## Gameplay Implications

### Deduction Challenges
- Hypotheses may be retroactively invalidated
- Evidence can be erased after examination
- Logical connections may never have existed
- Solutions require maintaining historical integrity

### Resource Management
- Time may be unwritten from the timeline
- Heat levels can be retroactively increased
- Resource expenditures may never have occurred
- Strategic use of anchors prevents total unraveling

### Agent Interactions
- Agent memories can be nullified
- Previous conversations may never have happened
- Agent existence can be retrogressed
- Trust becomes a fragile historical construct

### Success Conditions
- Cases require maintaining historical continuity
- Multiple mechanics must preserve reality
- Failure leads to complete retroactive erasure

## Technical Implementation Notes

### JSON Structure Additions
```json
{
  "advancedMechanics": {
    "retroactiveAnchor": {...},
    "causalReinforcer": {...},
    // ... other mechanics
  },
  "unmakingMechanics": {
    "retroactiveErasure": 0.999,
    "causalAnnihilation": 0.99,
    // ... other unmaking metrics
  },
  "unmakingEvents": [
    {
      "id": "UE1",
      "type": "retroactive-erasure",
      "description": "...",
      "triggerCondition": "...",
      "effect": "history_dissolution",
      "severity": 1
    }
    // ... more events
  ]
}
```

### UI Considerations
- Historical continuity meters
- Retrogression warning systems
- Memory coherence indicators
- Causal integrity displays

### Balance Considerations
- Unmaking levels scale from 1-12 across Season 11
- Each case becomes progressively more retroactive
- Multiple preservation mechanics provide survival strategies
- Resource costs reflect the existential stakes of maintaining reality

## Narrative Integration
Season 11 cases should emphasize:
- The horror of events never having occurred
- The terror of causal relationships being annihilated
- The dread of memories being nullified
- The ultimate confrontation with retroactive oblivion

This represents the complete transcendence beyond nothingness, where the very concept of existence is systematically erased from reality itself.
