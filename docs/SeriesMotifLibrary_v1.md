# Crimson Compass — Series Motif Library v1

**Purpose:** Procedural + tech blend motifs for generating new seasons and episodes.

## Core Motif Categories

### Procedural Motifs (Generated)
- **Infrastructure Shadows:** Hidden systems within visible tech (e.g., monitoring software in productivity tools)
- **Data Echoes:** Information patterns that persist beyond deletion
- **Network Ghosts:** Communications that route through unexpected channels
- **Algorithmic Whispers:** AI/ML systems with subtle secondary purposes

### Tech Blend Motifs (Combined)
- **Corporate Espionage + Digital Forensics:** Insider threats using company tools
- **Supply Chain + Zero-Day Exploits:** Hardware backdoors in legitimate components
- **Regulatory Compliance + Data Mining:** Legal frameworks hiding surveillance
- **Open Source + Proprietary Hooks:** Free software with embedded tracking

## Motif Generation Rules

### Rule 1: Dual Nature
Every motif must serve both legitimate business purpose AND shadow operation.

### Rule 2: Technical Credibility
Motifs must be based on real technology trends and plausible implementations.

### Rule 3: Escalation Path
Each motif should allow for increasing complexity across episode arcs.

## Example Motifs

### Motif: "Compliance Engine"
- **Surface:** Automated regulatory reporting system
- **Shadow:** Real-time data exfiltration disguised as compliance audits
- **Tech Blend:** GDPR compliance tools + covert data pipelines

### Motif: "Update Daemon"

## Usage in Season Generation
