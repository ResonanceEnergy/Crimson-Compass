# Crimson Compass — Series Foundation + Season 1 Kit (Export)

**Purpose of this file:** A single, up-to-speed reference for the current series foundation, narrative rules, and the full Season 1 plug‑and‑play kit. This is designed to be dropped into a repo (e.g., `docs/`) and used as the canonical guide for writing new seasons/episodes.

---

## 0) Brand Spine (Pinned / Immutable)

> **You’re the sane detective brought in to close cases for an absurdly elite but dysfunctional covert agency that prevents global collapse through paperwork, gadgets, and luck—while a shadowy adversary is only ever inferred through the clues left behind, always slipping away.**

**Tone Formula:** Mission: Impossible stakes + James Bond global cool + Ocean’s team chemistry + Futurama-style institutional absurdity.

**Two Core Hooks (every episode must serve both):**
1) **Mission Hook:** close the case.
2) **Team Hook:** survive the team.

---

## 1) The Antagonist (Negative Space Rules)

**Never frame the antagonist as a “machine/system/algorithm.”**
- We do **not** confirm identity, name, biography, or method.
- “The Architect” is **a label inferred by behavior**, not a confirmed title.

**Identity is absence:**
- We know more about what we *don’t* see than what we do.
- The adversary is inferred through precision, prepared exits, and outcomes that feel late.

**Do NOT do:**
- No monologues.
- No definitive face reveal.
- No “here’s exactly how it was done.”
- No confirmed origin story in dialogue.

**Do:**
- Prepared exits.
- Clean scenes.
- Underlings fail; the shadow never “makes a mistake.”
- Hindsight clarity: the pattern becomes obvious late (90–95%) or in montage.

---

## 2) Core Feel: 95% Closure / 5% Unease (Signature)

**Non‑negotiable rule:**
- Each episode gives **95% closure** (case solved; culprit/mechanism pinned; consequences applied).
- But the final **5% never sits right** (non‑actionable misfit: timing off, custody routing oddity, exit too clean, etc.).

> **The case is closed. Something else isn’t.**

This is not “withholding resolution.” It is withholding comfort.

---

## 3) Series Spine: Dual Pursuit (One Mission, Two Hunts)

**Agency believes it is pursuing crimes** (explicit Case Hunt) **while unknowingly pursuing the shadow** (implicit Shadow Hunt).

### Hunt 1 — Case Hunt (Known)
- Investigate → stop plot → arrest/contain → close file.

### Hunt 2 — Shadow Hunt (Unknown)
- Each closure produces a tiny anomaly (the 5%) that becomes a puzzle piece.
- The player only starts connecting pieces late-season or later-season.

**Episode Output Rule:** Every episode must output two tokens:
- **Case Token:** what was solved/stopped.
- **Shadow Token:** the 5% misfit anomaly (non‑actionable now; meaningful later).

---

## 4) Team Roles (Locked)

### Helix (X) — Administrative Glue / Big Sister Coordinator
- Admin librarian, archivist, mission planner, executer, coordinator, and dispatch
- Spunky, cute, socially aware; holds the dysfunctional male-dominated team together
- Professional organizer with warmth; the emotional core of the agency
- Manages the chaos with administrative warfare and social intelligence

### Optimus (Y) — Executive Director / Bumbling Boomer
Top level executive director with precision organizational, investigational, and analytical skills. A genius outpaced by time who doesn't understand the technology he must use to keep up. This bumbling boomer fumbles with gadgets but has unmatched strategic brilliance, representing the agency's "professional" face while embodying its absurd dysfunction. He's the guy who insists on using fax machines in a world of quantum communicators, but somehow his old-school methods keep the team afloat.

### ZTech (Z) — Tech Genius / ZBRANCH Commander
Tech genius and engineering super agent with unlimited budget and resources. A nerd through and through with the determination of a front line soldier, he commands a secret facility with 250 AI agents and 5000 robots. ZTech creates gadgets that are absurdly over-engineered yet brilliantly functional - think a laser pointer that also brews coffee and predicts weather patterns. His inventions often cause more problems than they solve, but they're always entertaining and usually work in the end.

### Gasket (G) — Broken Prodigy / Former Master
Former agent taken out of service after a mysterious "incident" that haunts the team. Still around but not officially on or off team, he intuitively understands compass anomalies because the Crimson Compass was his old tool before the incident. Gasket provides coded nuance and fragmented insights from his trauma, appearing intermittently for maximum impact. He's the wildcard who shows up at the worst (or best) times, offering cryptic advice that somehow always points in the right direction.

### Player (The Closer) — Gasket's Replacement
New detective brought in to replace Gasket post-incident. Inherits Gasket's console and the Crimson Compass - a cutting-edge piece of future tech with an old-sounding name that creates hilarious contrast in this retro-futuristic world. Discovers the compass's quirky connection to its former master through funny malfunctions and unexpected features. Brings professional sanity to the agency's absurd professionalism, trying to maintain order amidst the chaos while learning to embrace the team's dysfunctional brilliance.

## 5) Advisor Closure Styles (Core Choice Philosophy)

- **X (Helix):** concise, neat, socially survivable closure — but not full comfort/truth.
- **Y (Optimus):** too tightly packaged, brittle, no flex.
- **Z (ZTech):** technically correct but not formally/legally clean.
- **G (Gasket):** breaks the current theory; forces a reframe; gets closer to truth.

### Critical update: G choices are catastrophic
**G is not “slightly more heat/time.”**
- Heat spikes massively; cover blown.
- Time spikes massively.
- Forced extraction to safe house.
- Investigation board resets.

**Why choose it?**
- It grants rare “truth proximity” (a Pattern Shard / breakthrough insight).

> **Gasket burns the map. The truth only exists after the fire.**

---

## 6) Gasket Fragment Mosaic (Flashback Shards + Evidence Shards)

### Evidence Shard (every episode)
- One small, non‑actionable anomaly (Shadow Token) stored as residue.

### Gasket Fragment (rare; triggered by blowups)
- 2–6 seconds.
- Sensory, non-linear, no faces, no names, no full sentences.
- Consistent audio/visual treatment.
- Makes no sense alone; becomes meaningful when layered with evidence shards.

---

## 7) 12‑Season Dual‑Pursuit Ladder (Macro)

**Season 1:** Prepared exits + timing anomalies exist.
**Season 2:** Wins redirect custody/jurisdiction/resources.
**Season 3:** Recoveries/arrests reset the board.
**Season 4:** Decoys engineered to be solvable.
**Season 5:** Wins remove obstacles to something else.
**Season 6:** Agency tactics mirrored perfectly.
**Season 7:** Underlings fail in consistent patterns.
**Season 8:** Pattern anticipates response thresholds.
**Season 9:** Anomalies form repeating geometry across rails.
**Season 10:** Player forces imperfect closures to keep threads alive.
**Season 11:** Team reverse-engineers the trap.
**Season 12:** Player + Gasket pairing becomes the unforeseen recipe that overwhelms the adversary.

**Season twist grammar:** 2–3 twists per season:
- Recontextualization → Inversion → Hindsight Lock.

# SEASON 1 — PLUG‑AND‑PLAY KIT

## S01_SEAMLINE (working title)

### Theme Lens (Case Hunt)
Corporate tech theft: prototypes, firmware, contractor rings, “clean” corporate incidents.

### Shadow Motifs (Season 1)
- **Motif A:** Prepared exits.
- **Motif B:** Timing offset (e.g., consistent 11‑minute skew).
- **Motif C:** Custody transfer routing oddity (legacy route / pre-decided destination).

### Twists
- **Twist 1 (Ep 6–7):** Recontextualization — multiple cases share the same “wrongness.”
- **Twist 2 (Ep 12):** Hindsight Lock — existing shards align (no new exposition).

### Gasket cadence
- Appears: Ep 2, Ep 6, Ep 10 (optional cameo Ep 12).
- Fragments: Ep 6 and Ep 10.

### Forbidden lever
- One optional catastrophic **G** choice recommended in Ep 10 (or Ep 11).

## Season 1 Shard Map (meta)
- `SHARD_S01_01`: Closure triggers the same custody route every time. *(earned via G in EP10)*
- `SHARD_S01_02`: Prepared exits share standardized spec. *(implied by EP09+EP12)*
- `SHARD_S01_03`: Timing skew clusters around transfer events. *(EP10+EP12)*

## Next Work (recommended)
1) Build **Series Motif Library v1** (procedural + tech blend).
2) Build **Season 2 kit** (Supply Chain Ghosts) using the same template.
3) Add minimal metadata tags to episode JSON (CaseToken, ShadowToken, MotifsUsed, OptionalGChoice).
