## Prompt Engineering Tips for Grok Imagine

### Core Framework (5 Pillars)
1. **Subject & Character** (30% weight - first 20-30 words): Define the main element and its key traits
2. **Action & Motion** (For videos): Explicit verbs with physics, camera movement descriptions
3. **Environment & Setting**: Sensory details, scale, atmosphere building
4. **Cinematic Framing & Camera**: Lens types, shot composition, aspect ratios
5. **Aesthetic & Style**: Lighting, mood, art style, technical specifications

### Optimization Strategies
- **Length**: 50-200 words for balanced results, focus on vivid descriptive language
- **Consistency**: Always include "Futurama Detective Noir + Uncharted Action-Adventure fusion" first
- **Style Anchors**: "cel-shaded illustration, high contrast shadows, atmospheric lighting"
- **Technical**: Specify aspect ratios naturally ("9:16 vertical composition, 3:4 portrait ratio")
- **Video Specific**: Use linear actions, explicit motion verbs, camera directions

### Video Best Practices
- **Duration**: 6-15 seconds maximum per clip
- **Motion**: "slow deliberate movement", "rapid hand gestures", "smooth camera orbit"
- **Camera**: "handheld following", "close-up dynamic", "orbiting reveal"
- **Effects**: "building intensity", "pulsing illumination", "swirling particles"

### Quality Enhancement
- **Detail Level**: "high detail mechanical design", "photorealistic facial details"
- **Lighting**: "dramatic chiaroscuro", "volumetric fog effects", "mystical illumination"
- **Composition**: "cinematic composition", "suspenseful atmosphere", "professional stance"
