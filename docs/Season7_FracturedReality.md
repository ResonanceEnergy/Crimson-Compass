# Season 7: Fractured Reality - Operations where simulation and reality become indistinguishable

## Overview
Season 7 introduces the theme of "Fractured Reality," where adversaries create operations that blur the boundary between authentic reality and sophisticated simulations. Players must navigate layered simulations, validate neural patterns, and stabilize reality anchors while questioning the authenticity of their perceptions, memories, and operational environment.

## Core Mechanics

### WHO/HOW/WHERE Deduction System
**Reality-Enhanced Deduction**: Core triad system with simulation layer verification requirements
- **Layer Discrimination**: Players must identify which simulation layer contains authentic evidence
- **Anchor Validation**: Deductions require confirmation against reality anchors
- **Neural Verification**: Memory-based clues need neural pattern authentication
- **Fracture Penalties**: Wrong hypotheses in fractured realities carry additional time penalties
- **Simulation Bonuses**: Correct identification of simulation constructs provides resource rewards

**Deduction Rules**:
- Single correct solution with elimination feedback
- No partial credit to maintain reality verification pressure
- Reality penalties for confusion between authentic and simulated evidence
- Simulation bonuses for correctly identifying fabricated elements

### Time and Heat Management
**Resource Constraints**: 72-hour time budget with escalating existential heat levels
- **Reality Doubt**: Perfect simulations can cause operational paralysis
