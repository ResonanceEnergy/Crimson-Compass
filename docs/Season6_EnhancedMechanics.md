# Season 6: Agency Tactics Mirrored Perfectly

## Overview
Season 6 introduces the theme of "Agency tactics mirrored perfectly," where adversaries execute criminal operations using tactics that precisely replicate agency methods. This creates a psychological horror element where players question the authenticity of their own operational doctrine.

## Core Mechanics Implementation

### WHO/HOW/WHERE Deduction System
**Enhanced Complexity**: Mirror tactics add layers of uncertainty to basic deduction
- **Authenticity Verification**: Players must distinguish between genuine agency methods and perfect copies
- **Method Confusion**: Adversary tactics can appear identical to agency procedures
- **Mirror Penalties**: Wrong hypotheses involving mirrored methods carry additional time penalties
- **Authenticity Bonuses**: Correct identification of authentic methods provides resource bonuses

**Deduction Rules**:
- Single correct solution with elimination feedback
- No partial credit to maintain authenticity pressure
- Mirror penalties for confusion between real and replicated methods
- Authenticity bonuses for verified genuine identifications

### Time and Heat Management
**Resource Constraints**: 72-hour time budget with escalating heat levels
- **Tactical Paralysis**: Perfect mimicry can cause decision hesitation
- **Signature Verification**: Additional time cost for confirming method authenticity
- **Heat Escalation**: False positives in mirror detection increase operational heat

**Heat Levels**:
- **Low Heat (1)**: Minor doubt, authenticity hints, method questions
- **Medium Heat (3)**: Tactical paralysis, mirror detection, signature verification required
- **High Heat (5)**: Existential crisis, reality fracture, total mimicry exposure

**Time Penalties** (Mirror-Themed):
- Wrong hypothesis: 4 hours
- Failed scan: 2 hours
- Mirror confusion: 6 hours (additional penalty for method uncertainty)
- Authenticity error: 5 hours
- Paradox event: 8 hours
- Jurisdiction puzzle: 7 hours

## Clue System & Decision Points

### Mirror-Themed Clue Types
**Authenticity Clues**: Evidence questioning method authenticity (80% reliable, 30% mirror contamination risk)
**Timing Clues**: Temporal anomalies in operational sequences (90% reliable, 40% paradox risk)
**Network Clues**: Connections in mirror replication webs (70% reliable, 50% confusion risk)

**Clue Mechanics**:
- 8-clue collection limit with verification requirements
- Mirror contamination risks requiring authenticity checks
- Recovery bonuses for successfully verified clues

### Decision Points
Critical choice moments with mirror-themed consequences:

**Mirror Detection Response**:
- Verify authenticity (3 hours, 1 heat risk) → Confidence gain
- Accept mirror (1 hour, 2 heat risk) → Paradox risk
- Deploy recovery (5 hours, 0 heat risk) → Fragment recovery

**Timing Anomaly Handling**:
- Analyze timing (4 hours, 1 heat risk) → Synchronization break
- Ignore anomaly (0 hours, 3 heat risk) → Causality fracture
- Jurisdiction check (6 hours, 2 heat risk) → Authority clarification

## Gameplay Flow
