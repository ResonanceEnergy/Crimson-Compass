## 🔄 Detective-Uncharted Fusion

The game now blends:

- **Interrogation + Character Dynamics** = Team banter during investigations
- **Mystery Solving + Action Sequences** = Cinematic chases and confrontations

## Character Ensemble Overhaul

### Omega (Y): Transformed from "Optimus" (dry intel luck paradox) to Executive Director / Bumbling Boomer
- A genius outpaced by technology who represents the agency's absurd professionalism

### Helix (X): Enhanced from basic "Big Sister Glue" to Administrative Glue / Big Sister Coordinator
- The emotional core managing chaos with administrative warfare

### ZTech (Z): Expanded from "Insane Technical Ability" to Tech Genius / ZBRANCH Commander
- Commands 250 AI agents and 5000 robots with unlimited resources

### Gasket (G): Deepened from "Unofficial Wildcard" to Broken Prodigy / Former Master
- Intuitively understands compass anomalies because it's his old tool

### Player (The Closer): Evolved from "Reality Punch" to Gasket's Replacement
- Inherits the haunted Crimson Compass and brings professional sanity

## Narrative Integration

**Crimson Compass Artifact:** Now haunted by Gasket's ghost, creating personal stakes

**Uncharted Action-Adventure:** Environmental puzzles, high-stakes chases, treasure hunting elements

**Futurama Detective Noir:** Bright saturated colors, retro-futuristic absurdity, professional execution

**12-Season Structure:** 144 episodes with micro-episode format (5 minutes, 2-3 scenes each)

## Core Elements Unified

**95% Closure / 5% Unease:** Cases solved but compass anomalies haunt the player

**Dual Pursuit:** Explicit case hunts + implicit shadow hunts through compass anomalies

**Team Chemistry:** Ocean's Eleven-style dysfunctional brilliance with emotional depth
