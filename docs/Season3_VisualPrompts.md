## Seasonal Evolution Notes

**From Season 2:** Supply chain weaponization evolves into recovery system compromise. Physical logistics become institutional protocols.

**Visual Metaphors:**
- Paradox: Conflicting realities overlaid, quantum uncertainty effects
- Recovery: Medical/scientific decontamination aesthetics
- Custody: Prison/jail institutional design with timing distortions

**Character Development:**
- Agents show wear from institutional betrayal
- Suspects appear more systemic, less individual
- Adversary hints become more reality-bending</content>
