# Crimson Compass Saga: The Novel

## Prologue: The Recruit

In the neon-drenched underbelly of a forgotten city, where the world's elite play their games, Agent [Player Name] awoke with no memory of how they got there. A glitchy AI named Gasket flickered on a cracked screen: "Humanity detected. Welcome to the Compass."

Helix, the nurturing handler with a hidden agenda, briefed them: "You're the closer. We prevent global collapses—economies, tech, whatever's about to tip." Optimus, the deadpan operative, added, "Luck's on our side. Mostly." ZTech, the gadget genius, handed over a suitcase of wonders: drones that order pizza, lockpicks that recite poetry.

The first mission: a corporate heist in London. Contractors siphoning prototypes. A chase through the Tube, gadgets failing spectacularly. "Plan A: Shoot. Plan B: Shoot better," Optimus quipped as they evaded security.

But something felt off. The win was too clean. Gasket muttered, "Patterns... not right." The unease began.
