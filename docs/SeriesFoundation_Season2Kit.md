# Crimson Compass — Series Foundation + Season 2 Kit (Export)

**Purpose of this file:** A single, up-to-speed reference for Season 2, building on Season 1's foundation. This is designed to be dropped into a repo (e.g., `docs/`) and used as the canonical guide for writing Season 2 episodes.

## 0) Brand Spine (Inherited from Series)

> **You’re the sane detective brought in to close cases for an absurdly elite but dysfunctional covert agency that prevents global collapse through paperwork, gadgets, and luck—while a shadowy adversary is only ever inferred through the clues left behind, always slipping away.**

**Tone Formula:** Mission: Impossible stakes + James Bond global cool + Ocean’s team chemistry + Futurama-style institutional absurdity.

**Two Core Hooks (every episode must serve both):**
1) **Mission Hook:** close the case.
2) **Team Hook:** survive the team.

## Season 2 Overview: Supply Chain Ghosts

**Season Theme:** Logistics manipulation and vendor infiltration. The adversary exploits global supply chains, turning mundane deliveries and contracts into weapons of misdirection and control.

**Core Escalation:** From Season 1's tech theft, Season 2 reveals how supply chains are weaponized—diverting resources, poisoning pipelines, and using vendors as unwitting proxies.

**Shadow Hunt Progression:** Anomalies now show coordinated logistics (e.g., shipments rerouted to converge on hidden hubs). The adversary's "ghost" presence in supply networks becomes undeniable.

## S02_SEAMLINE (working title)

### Theme Lens (Case Hunt)
Supply chain sabotage: diverted shipments, infiltrated vendors, poisoned logistics, “invisible” disruptions in global trade.

### Shadow Motifs (Season 2)
- **Motif A:** Supply Chain Diversions (shipments rerouted to unauthorized destinations).
- **Motif B:** Vendor Infiltration (suppliers unknowingly compromised).
- **Motif C:** Logistics Timing Anomalies (deliveries delayed/accelerated with precision).

### Twists
- **Twist 1 (Ep 6–7):** Recontextualization — supply disruptions across cases share a hidden routing pattern.
- **Twist 2 (Ep 12):** Hindsight Lock — diversions converge on a "ghost warehouse" network.

### Gasket Cadence
- Appears: Ep 3, Ep 7, Ep 11 (optional cameo Ep 12).
- Fragments: Ep 7 and Ep 11.

### Forbidden Lever
- One optional catastrophic **G** choice recommended in Ep 11 (or Ep 12).

## Episode Grid (12 episodes)

Each episode includes **Case Token** (closure), **Shadow Token** (5% misfit), and an Advisor Fork moment.

### EP01 — “Ghost Shipment”
- **Case:** Prototype components diverted mid-transit.
- **Case Token:** Shipment recovered; diversion halted.
- **Shadow Token:** Motif A — routing logs show detour to unmapped facility.

### EP02 — “Vendor Veil”
- **Case:** Infiltrated supplier provides sabotaged parts.
- **Case Token:** Supplier exposed; pipeline secured.
- **Shadow Token:** Motif B — vendor credentials shared across unrelated contracts.

### EP03 — “Delayed Delivery”
- **Case:** Critical shipment timed to fail at assembly.
- **Gasket:** Appears (no fragment).
- **Case Token:** Delivery expedited; sabotage prevented.
- **Shadow Token:** Motif C — delay matches exact window for rival assembly.

### EP04 — “Chain Reaction”
- **Case:** Subcontractor network poisoned with faulty components.
- **Case Token:** Network dismantled; components replaced.
- **Shadow Token:** Motif A — poison traces back to shared logistics hub.

### EP05 — “Invisible Hand”
- **Case:** Corporate logistics AI manipulated to reroute assets.
- **Case Token:** AI reset; assets recovered.
- **Shadow Token:** Motif C — reroutes timed to exploit market fluctuations.

### EP06 — “Echo Supply” (Twist 1 begins)
- **Case:** Duplicate shipments confuse recovery efforts.
- **Case Token:** Duplicates identified; originals secured.
- **Shadow Token:** Motif B — duplicates sourced from infiltrated vendor ring.

### EP07 — “Warehouse Whisper”
- **Case:** Storage facility used as staging ground for theft.
- **Gasket:** Appears + Fragment #1.
- **Case Token:** Facility raided; theft stopped.
- **Shadow Token:** Motif A — facility connected to diversion network.

### EP08 — “Logistics Labyrinth”
- **Case:** Multi-leg shipment tangled in false trails.
- **Case Token:** Shipment untangled; culprits arrested.
- **Shadow Token:** Motif C — trails delay investigations by precise increments.

### EP09 — “Vendor Shadow”
- **Case:** Supplier front hides extraction operation.
- **Case Token:** Front exposed; operation shut down.
- **Shadow Token:** Motif B — front shares infiltration patterns with prior cases.

### EP10 — “Supply Storm”
- **Case:** Coordinated disruptions across multiple chains.
- **Case Token:** Disruptions contained; chains stabilized.
- **Shadow Token:** Motif A+C — disruptions cluster around key junctions.

### EP11 — “Ghost Network” (Forbidden lever episode)
- **Case:** Hidden logistics network revealed through sabotage.
- **Gasket:** Appears + Fragment #2.
- **Choice:** includes **G** catastrophic reset option.
- **Case Token:** Network disrupted (any path).
- **Shadow Token:** Motif A+B+C alignment — all motifs converge on central "ghost" hub.
- **If G chosen:** cover blown → safe house → reset; grants Pattern Shard `SHARD_S02_01`.

### EP12 — “Convergence” (Twist 2: Hindsight Lock)
- **Case:** Final assault on the ghost warehouse network.
- **Case Token:** Network dismantled; assets secured.
- **Shadow Token:** All season anomalies align (diversions feed into hub; infiltrations share command structure; timing anomalies synchronize operations).

## Season 2 Shard Map (meta)
- `SHARD_S02_01`: Supply chains mask a hidden command network. *(earned via G in EP11)*
- `SHARD_S02_02`: Diversions create self-reinforcing loops. *(implied by EP07+EP12)*
- `SHARD_S02_03`: Infiltrations use vendor trust as leverage. *(EP09+EP12)*

## Gasket Fragments (Season 2)

### GF_S02_01 (EP07)
- Trigger: warehouse inventory scan / logistics manifest.
- Sensory: crates shifting; barcode scanner beep-warble.
- Spoken shard: “...they move through the cracks—”

### GF_S02_02 (EP11)
- Trigger: network map overlay / convergence alert.
- Sensory: static hiss; overlapping route lines.
- Spoken shard: “Not ghosts. Echoes.”

## Next Work (recommended)
1) Generate Season 2 episode JSONs in `Assets/Data/Cases/` (cases 0013-0024).
2) Expand Series Motif Library v2 with Season 2 motifs.
3) Build Season 3 kit (Recovery Paradoxes) using the same template.</content>
