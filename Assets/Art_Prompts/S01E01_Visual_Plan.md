# S01E01 Visual Assets Plan

## Overview
Focused visual asset creation for Season 1 Episode 1: "Welcome Packet". This episode introduces the player to the agency team and basic mechanics on an urban rooftop stakeout.

**Visual Style**: Futurama Detective Noir - thick black outlines, bright saturated colors, exaggerated features, retro-futuristic absurdity with professional polish.

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Background Creation (1-2 days)
1. Generate multiple rooftop variations with different weather/lighting and thick outlines
2. Test atmospheric absurdity and mobile performance
3. Ensure Futurama aesthetic consistency with professional execution

### Phase 2: Character Portraits (2-3 days)
1. Create base portraits for all 8 characters (5 agents + 3 NPCs) with exaggerated features
2. Develop expression variations (neutral, speaking, intense, suspicious) with over-the-top emotions
3. Verify thick outlines and bright colors maintain impact on mobile

### Phase 2.5: Crimson Compass Creation (1-2 days)
1. Design the central artifact in multiple states (inactive, scanning, warning, calibrating)
